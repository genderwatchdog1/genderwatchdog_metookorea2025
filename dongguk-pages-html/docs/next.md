I've analyzed the SEO implementation of your Korean page compared to Dongguk's page. Here's my assessment:

## Current SEO Advantages Over Dongguk
- **Meta tags**: Your page has comprehensive meta tags including description, keywords, and social media tags while Dongguk's page lacks these entirely
- **Structured data**: Your page implements proper schema.org markup (Article and FAQPage schemas) while Dongguk has none
- **Descriptive URL**: Your domain structure is more SEO-friendly than Dongguk's numeric URLs (/page/2062)
- **Mobile optimization**: Your site is properly responsive with Bootstrap while Dongguk's has multiple scripts slowing it down
- **Content depth**: Your page provides comprehensive information with statistics and evidence versus Dongguk's limited quiz-only approach
- **Keyword optimization**: Your content naturally incorporates key Korean terms like "동국대 성폭력" and "성인지 감수성"
- **Ethical improvements**: Your content directly addresses and corrects Dongguk's problematic statements, creating more valuable information

## Recommendations to Further Improve Rankings
1. Add more **internal linking** between sections using keyword-rich anchor text
2. Implement the Korean-specific **ArticleBodyContents schema** specifically for Naver
3. Consider adding a **FAQ section** using the exact question formats from Naver Trends like "성인지 감수성이란 무엇인가?"
4. Create **citation links** to the KWDI report statistics for increased credibility
5. Add a "**성인지 감수성 테스트의 문제점**" heading with more direct SEO-optimized text

Your current implementation has strong advantages over Dongguk's page and will likely outrank it, especially with the targeted keywords related to "동국대 성폭력" and critical analysis of their approach. The combination of technical SEO, content depth, and addressing the ethical issues directly gives your page significant advantages.
