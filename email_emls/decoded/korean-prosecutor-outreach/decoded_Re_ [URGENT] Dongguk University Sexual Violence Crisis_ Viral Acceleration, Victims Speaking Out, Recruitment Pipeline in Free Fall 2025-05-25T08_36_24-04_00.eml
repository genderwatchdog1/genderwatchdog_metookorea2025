(영어 다음에 한국어가 나옵니다.)Subject: URGENT FOLLOW-UP: Viral Evidence of Ongoing Sexual Violence at Dongguk University - Immediate Investigation of Sidus FNH Personnel Required

To: President and international office of Dongguk University; Supreme Prosecutors' Office; National Police Agency; Korean government Agencies (ROK); Leading Korean newsrooms and journalists; Embassies of China and the top ten student-sending countries in Korea; Korean Film Council (KOFIC)

Cc: Advocacy organizations, Title IX organizations, and international film industry partners

**URGENT FOLLOW-UP TO OUR MAY 25, 2025 VIRAL XIAOHONGSHU EVIDENCE SUBMISSION**

We are writing to provide critical updates following our viral Xiaohongshu posts that have generated over 20,000 views and multiple victim testimonies, including new evidence of ongoing sexual violence against international students at Dongguk University's Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents.

**NEW EVIDENCE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE SIDUS FNH INVESTIGATION:**

A victim testimony that emerged from our viral post states:
*"Last semester, a foreign student in the film program was sexually harassed by a senior student."*

This confirms that sexual violence continues to occur against international students in Dongguk's film programs. **We suspect that senior male students are mirroring the behavior they see from Sidus FNH personnel and faculty at Dongguk Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents.**

**SIDUS FNH MUST BE IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM CAMPUS AND INVESTIGATED**

Sidus FNH shares the Chungmuro Video Center building with Dongguk University, creating a toxic environment where industry professionals may be modeling inappropriate behavior that students then replicate. This shared facility arrangement must end immediately.

## PREVIOUS KOFIC AND SIDUS FNH NOTIFICATIONS (MAY 20, 2025)

On May 20, 2025, we sent the following comprehensive email to KOFIC and other Korean film industry authorities demanding immediate suspension of all Sidus FNH films:

---

**[FULL TEXT OF MAY 20, 2025 KOFIC EMAIL FOLLOWS]**

Subject: Urgent Request for Immediate Suspension of Sidus FNH Films Pending Investigation – Sexual Violence, Institutional Cover-ups, and Public Funds Misuse at Dongguk University

To: Korean Film Council (KOFIC), Ministry of Education, National Human Rights Commission, National Assembly, Korean Council for University Education, and other relevant authorities

Dear KOFIC and relevant authorities,

We are writing on behalf of the Gender Watchdog Research Collective, an international advocacy group focused on sexual violence prevention, institutional accountability, and global compliance in higher education and the film industry. This message is being forwarded to you, as well as to major international film organizations, platforms, and distributors, in light of urgent and systemic concerns regarding Sidus FNH and its relationship with Dongguk University's Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents.

**Summary of Concerns:**
- Multiple, credible allegations of sexual violence, cover-ups, and retaliation at Dongguk University, particularly within the Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents, are now documented and under international scrutiny.
- Sidus FNH shares the Chungmuro Video Center building with Dongguk University, blurring the boundaries between industry and academia and increasing risk to students and young professionals ([Dongguk University source](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;)).
- The Korean film industry has a well-documented, ongoing crisis of sexual violence and harassment, as detailed in the 2019 research summary ([link](http://solido.kr/wp-content/uploads/2019-Sexual-Violence%C2%B7Sexual-Harassment-in-the-korean-film-industry-Research-summary.pdf?ckattempt=1)).
- There are credible allegations of falsified international partnerships and misuse of public funds at Dongguk University, with Sidus FNH implicated by association and proximity.
- Recent high-profile cases (e.g., Kim Ki-duk) demonstrate the industry's failure to protect victims and the urgent need for institutional accountability ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/07/three-woman-accuse-korean-director-kim-ki-duk-rape-assault)).

**Immediate Demands:**
1. **Immediate Suspension:**
   - All Korean films (and, where applicable, foreign films) made or distributed by Sidus FNH must be immediately suspended from screening, distribution, and festival participation until a full, independent investigation is completed into:
     - Sexual violence and cover-ups at Dongguk University and Sidus FNH
     - Falsified international partnerships and public funds misuse
     - The role of Sidus FNH in enabling or failing to prevent these abuses
2. **Transparency and Accountability:**
   - KOFIC must explain why Sidus FNH was permitted to share space with Dongguk University despite the known, documented risks and ongoing sexual violence crisis in the Korean film industry.
   - KOFIC must outline concrete steps to support and protect victims who come forward, including students, alumni, and staff, and ensure that all perpetrators (including professors, Sidus FNH staff, alumni, and administrators) are investigated and prosecuted.
3. **International Notification:**
   - This message and the attached documentation are being shared with all major international film festivals, platforms (Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc.), distributors, and film organizations in the top international student source countries, as well as with advocacy and compliance networks.

**Sidus FNH Film List:**
Below is a partial list of Korean and foreign films made or distributed by Sidus FNH, compiled from public sources and the official Sidus FNH movie list ([http://sidus.com/eng/full_movie_list.asp](http://sidus.com/eng/full_movie_list.asp)). We demand that all such films be suspended from screening and distribution until the investigation is complete.

**Key Questions for KOFIC:**
- Why was Sidus FNH allowed to share space with Dongguk University given the well-documented risks and ongoing sexual violence crisis in the Korean film industry?
- What immediate steps will KOFIC take to suspend all Sidus FNH films and protect the public, students, and industry workers?
- How will KOFIC support and protect victims who come forward, including students, alumni, and staff, and ensure that all perpetrators (including professors, Sidus FNH staff, alumni, and administrators) are investigated and prosecuted?
- What reforms will KOFIC implement to prevent future abuses and ensure full compliance with international standards for sexual violence prevention, ESG, and public accountability?

We expect a prompt, public response within one week. Silence or inaction will be documented and shared with all relevant domestic and international partners, platforms, and advocacy networks.

## SIDUS FNH DIRECT NOTIFICATION (MAY 20, 2025)

On the same date, Sidus FNH was directly contacted with the following inquiry:

**Subject:** Inquiry Regarding Sexual Violence Risk Management and Reporting Mechanisms at Sidus FNH – Shared Facility with Dongguk University

**To the Sidus FNH Management Team,**

I am writing on behalf of the Gender Watchdog Research Collective, an international advocacy group focused on sexual violence prevention, institutional accountability, and global compliance in higher education and the film industry.

Our investigation has revealed that Sidus FNH shares the 'Choong-Moo-Ro Yeong-Sang Center' building with Dongguk University's Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents, as confirmed on Dongguk's official website ([source](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;)). This arrangement raises significant concerns about boundary management, student safety, and the potential for sexual violence in environments where industry and academia intersect without robust oversight.

We are contacting you as part of our vertical escalation strategy, which aims to set a new standard for accountability in the Korean film industry and its global partners. Our advocacy is closely followed by U.S. and international organizations, including ESG and corporate responsibility groups, Title IX organizations, feminist film networks, and major film distributors such as Netflix, Disney, and Amazon. We are also in the process of alerting your partners across Asia to the ongoing investigations at Dongguk University, which may have implications for all organizations sharing facilities or collaborating with the university.

Given the gravity of the situation, we request your response to the following questions:

1. **Sexual Violence Data:**
   - What records or data does Sidus FNH maintain regarding incidents or allegations of sexual violence, harassment, or boundary violations involving students, staff, or visitors in the Choong-Moo-Ro Yeong-Sang Center?
   - Has Sidus FNH ever received or investigated complaints related to sexual violence or inappropriate conduct involving Dongguk University students or faculty?

2. **Independent Reporting Mechanisms:**
   - Does Sidus FNH have an independent, confidential reporting mechanism for sexual violence or misconduct, accessible to students, interns, or visitors who may interact with your staff or facilities?
   - If so, how are these mechanisms publicized and what protections are in place for whistleblowers or victims?

3. **Policies on Student Interaction:**
   - What formal policies or codes of conduct govern interactions between Sidus FNH staff and Dongguk University students, particularly female students?
   - Are there clear guidelines on prohibited behaviors, chaperoning, or professional boundaries, especially in shared spaces such as elevators, cafeterias, and hallways?
   - Are all staff and contractors required to undergo regular sexual violence prevention training?

4. **ESG and International Compliance:**
   - As a company with potential or actual relationships with global platforms (Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc.), what steps does Sidus FNH take to ensure compliance with international standards on sexual violence prevention, ESG reporting, and Title IX-related obligations?
   - How does Sidus FNH communicate these standards to its partners and stakeholders?

We are aware that Dongguk University has a documented history of structural sexual violence risks, including:
- All-male faculty in the graduate film program
- No independent sexual violence reporting mechanisms
- Documented cases of retaliation and silencing of survivors
- The 2020 KWDI report showing an 81/100 risk score for sexual violence in film departments

Given the shared facility and the blurred boundaries between academia and industry, Sidus FNH's response to these questions is of urgent public interest. Silence or non-response will be noted in our ongoing reporting to international partners, advocacy organizations, and the media.

We invite you to clarify your position and demonstrate leadership in setting a new standard for safety and accountability in the Korean film industry. Your response will be included in our public documentation and shared with our global network.

---

## IMMEDIATE DEMANDS FOLLOWING VIRAL EVIDENCE:

**1. IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF SIDUS FNH FROM DONGGUK CAMPUS**
- Sidus FNH personnel must be immediately moved off campus
- All shared facility arrangements must be terminated pending investigation
- Investigation must include all Sidus FNH personnel who may have modeled inappropriate behavior that students are now replicating

**2. KOFIC MUST FOLLOW THROUGH ON FILM BANS**
- All Sidus FNH films must be banned from screening and distribution within Korea
- KOFIC must implement immediate suspension as demanded in our May 20 email

**3. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION REQUESTED**
- We ask for the cooperation of the embassies of all countries in our recipient list to implement similar bans in your respective countries
- International film festivals and distributors must be notified of the ongoing investigation

**4. COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION**
- Korean prosecutors and police must investigate all Sidus FNH personnel for potential involvement in creating the toxic environment that enables student-on-student sexual violence
- The investigation must examine how industry professionals may be modeling inappropriate behavior that students then replicate

The viral evidence from over 20,000 Xiaohongshu viewers demonstrates that this crisis extends beyond the university into the film industry itself. Immediate action is required to protect international students and restore integrity to Korean higher education and the film industry.

We expect immediate action within 48 hours. Continued silence will result in escalated international pressure and documentation of institutional failure to protect victims.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog Research Collective

제목: 긴급 후속 조치: 동국대학교 지속적 성폭력의 바이럴 증거 - Sidus FNH 직원에 대한 즉각적 수사 필요

수신: 동국대학교 총장 및 국제처; 대검찰청; 경찰청; 대한민국 정부 유관 부처; 주요 한국 언론사 및 기자; 중국 및 한국 내 주요 10개 유학생 송출국 대사관; 영화진흥위원회(KOFIC)

참조: 인권/젠더 옹호 단체, Title IX 관련 단체, 국제 영화 산업 파트너

**2025년 5월 25일 바이럴 샤오홍슈 증거 제출에 대한 긴급 후속 조치**

저희는 2만 회 이상의 조회수와 다수의 피해자 증언을 기록한 바이럴 샤오홍슈 포스트 이후, 동국대학교 디지털영상콘텐츠대학원에서 외국인 유학생을 대상으로 한 지속적 성폭력의 새로운 증거를 포함한 중요한 업데이트를 제공하기 위해 이 글을 작성합니다.

**새로운 증거로 인한 Sidus FNH 즉각 수사 필요:**

저희 바이럴 포스트에서 나온 피해자 증언:
*"지난 학기, 영상학과 외국인 유학생이 선배에게 성희롱을 당했다."*

이는 동국대 영상학과에서 외국인 유학생을 대상으로 한 성폭력이 계속 발생하고 있음을 확인해줍니다. **저희는 남학생 선배들이 동국대 디지털영상콘텐츠대학원의 Sidus FNH 직원과 교수진에게서 보는 행동을 모방하고 있다고 의심합니다.**

**Sidus FNH는 즉시 캠퍼스에서 퇴거되고 수사받아야 합니다**

Sidus FNH는 동국대학교와 충무로영상센터 건물을 공유하고 있어, 업계 전문가들이 부적절한 행동을 모델링하고 학생들이 이를 모방하는 독성 환경을 조성하고 있습니다. 이러한 공유 시설 협정은 즉시 종료되어야 합니다.

## 이전 KOFIC 및 Sidus FNH 통보 (2025년 5월 20일)

2025년 5월 20일, 저희는 모든 Sidus FNH 영화의 즉각적 상영 중단을 요구하며 KOFIC 및 기타 한국 영화 산업 당국에 다음과 같은 종합적인 이메일을 발송했습니다:

---

**[2025년 5월 20일 KOFIC 이메일 전문]**

제목: Sidus FNH 영화 즉각 상영 중단 긴급 요청 – 동국대학교 성폭력, 제도적 은폐, 공적 자금 오용 수사 대기

수신: 영화진흥위원회(KOFIC), 교육부, 국가인권위원회, 국회, 한국대학교육협의회, 기타 관련 당국

KOFIC 및 관련 당국 귀하,

저희는 성폭력 예방, 제도적 책임, 고등교육 및 영화 산업의 글로벌 컴플라이언스에 중점을 둔 국제 옹호 단체인 젠더워치독 연구 집단을 대표하여 이 글을 작성합니다. 이 메시지는 동국대학교 디지털미디어콘텐츠대학원과 Sidus FNH의 관계에 관한 긴급하고 체계적인 우려사항과 관련하여 주요 국제 영화 기관, 플랫폼, 배급사에도 전달되고 있습니다.

**우려사항 요약:**
- 동국대학교, 특히 디지털미디어콘텐츠대학원 내 성폭력, 은폐, 보복에 대한 다수의 신빙성 있는 혐의가 현재 문서화되어 국제적 감시를 받고 있습니다.
- Sidus FNH는 동국대학교와 충무로영상센터 건물을 공유하여 산업과 학계의 경계를 모호하게 하고 학생과 젊은 전문가들에게 위험을 증가시키고 있습니다 ([동국대학교 출처](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;)).
- 한국 영화 산업은 2019년 연구 요약에 자세히 설명된 바와 같이 잘 문서화된 지속적인 성폭력 및 괴롭힘 위기를 겪고 있습니다 ([링크](http://solido.kr/wp-content/uploads/2019-Sexual-Violence%C2%B7Sexual-Harassment-in-the-korean-film-industry-Research-summary.pdf?ckattempt=1)).
- 동국대학교에서 허위 국제 협력 관계 및 공적 자금 오용에 대한 신빙성 있는 혐의가 있으며, Sidus FNH가 연관성과 근접성으로 인해 연루되어 있습니다.
- 최근 고프로필 사건들(예: 김기덕)은 업계가 피해자를 보호하지 못하고 제도적 책임이 시급히 필요함을 보여줍니다 ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/07/three-woman-accuse-korean-director-kim-ki-duk-rape-assault)).

## Sidus FNH 직접 통보 (2025년 5월 20일)

같은 날, Sidus FNH에 다음과 같은 문의가 직접 전달되었습니다:

**제목:** Sidus FNH의 성폭력 위험 관리 및 신고 메커니즘에 관한 문의 – 동국대학교와의 공유 시설

**Sidus FNH 경영진 귀하,**

저는 성폭력 예방, 제도적 책임, 고등교육 및 영화 산업의 글로벌 컴플라이언스에 중점을 둔 국제 옹호 단체인 젠더워치독 연구 집단을 대표하여 이 글을 작성합니다.

저희 조사에 따르면 Sidus FNH는 동국대학교 공식 웹사이트에서 확인된 바와 같이 동국대학교 디지털미디어콘텐츠대학원과 '충무로영상센터' 건물을 공유하고 있습니다 ([출처](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;)). 이러한 협정은 경계 관리, 학생 안전, 그리고 강력한 감독 없이 산업과 학계가 교차하는 환경에서의 성폭력 가능성에 대한 심각한 우려를 제기합니다.

저희는 한국 영화 산업과 그 글로벌 파트너들에게 새로운 책임 기준을 설정하는 것을 목표로 하는 수직적 확대 전략의 일환으로 귀하에게 연락드리고 있습니다. 저희 옹호 활동은 ESG 및 기업 책임 그룹, Title IX 조직, 페미니스트 영화 네트워크, Netflix, Disney, Amazon과 같은 주요 영화 배급사를 포함한 미국 및 국제 조직들이 면밀히 주시하고 있습니다. 또한 저희는 동국대학교에서 진행 중인 수사에 대해 아시아 전역의 귀하의 파트너들에게 알리는 과정에 있으며, 이는 대학과 시설을 공유하거나 협력하는 모든 조직에 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.

상황의 심각성을 고려하여, 저희는 다음 질문들에 대한 귀하의 응답을 요청합니다:

1. **성폭력 데이터:**
   - Sidus FNH는 충무로영상센터에서 학생, 직원, 방문자와 관련된 성폭력, 괴롭힘, 경계 위반 사건이나 혐의에 대해 어떤 기록이나 데이터를 유지하고 있습니까?
   - Sidus FNH는 동국대학교 학생이나 교수진과 관련된 성폭력이나 부적절한 행위에 대한 신고를 받거나 수사한 적이 있습니까?

2. **독립적 신고 메커니즘:**
   - Sidus FNH는 귀하의 직원이나 시설과 상호작용할 수 있는 학생, 인턴, 방문자가 접근할 수 있는 성폭력이나 부정행위에 대한 독립적이고 기밀적인 신고 메커니즘을 가지고 있습니까?
   - 그렇다면, 이러한 메커니즘은 어떻게 홍보되며 내부고발자나 피해자를 위한 어떤 보호 조치가 마련되어 있습니까?

3. **학생 상호작용 정책:**
   - Sidus FNH 직원과 동국대학교 학생, 특히 여학생 간의 상호작용을 규율하는 공식적인 정책이나 행동 강령은 무엇입니까?
   - 엘리베이터, 카페테리아, 복도와 같은 공유 공간에서 특히 금지된 행동, 동행, 전문적 경계에 대한 명확한 지침이 있습니까?
   - 모든 직원과 계약자는 정기적인 성폭력 예방 교육을 받아야 합니까?

4. **ESG 및 국제 컴플라이언스:**
   - 글로벌 플랫폼(Netflix, Disney, Amazon 등)과 잠재적이거나 실제적인 관계를 가진 회사로서, Sidus FNH는 성폭력 예방, ESG 보고, Title IX 관련 의무에 대한 국제 기준 준수를 보장하기 위해 어떤 조치를 취하고 있습니까?
   - Sidus FNH는 이러한 기준을 파트너와 이해관계자들에게 어떻게 전달하고 있습니까?

저희는 동국대학교가 다음을 포함한 구조적 성폭력 위험의 문서화된 역사를 가지고 있음을 알고 있습니다:
- 대학원 영화 프로그램의 전체 남성 교수진
- 독립적인 성폭력 신고 메커니즘 부재
- 생존자에 대한 보복과 침묵의 문서화된 사례
- 영화과의 성폭력 위험도 81/100을 보여주는 2020년 KWDI 보고서

공유 시설과 학계와 산업 간의 모호한 경계를 고려할 때, 이러한 질문들에 대한 Sidus FNH의 응답은 긴급한 공적 관심사입니다. 침묵이나 무응답은 국제 파트너, 옹호 조직, 언론에 대한 저희의 지속적인 보고에 기록될 것입니다.

저희는 귀하가 입장을 명확히 하고 한국 영화 산업에서 안전과 책임에 대한 새로운 기준을 설정하는 데 리더십을 보여주시기를 초대합니다. 귀하의 응답은 저희의 공개 문서에 포함되고 글로벌 네트워크와 공유될 것입니다.

## 바이럴 증거에 따른 즉각적 요구사항:

**1. 동국대 캠퍼스에서 Sidus FNH 즉시 퇴거**
- Sidus FNH 직원은 즉시 캠퍼스에서 이전되어야 합니다
- 모든 공유 시설 협정은 수사 대기 중 종료되어야 합니다
- 수사는 학생들이 현재 모방하고 있는 부적절한 행동을 모델링했을 수 있는 모든 Sidus FNH 직원을 포함해야 합니다

**2. KOFIC은 영화 금지 조치를 이행해야 합니다**
- 모든 Sidus FNH 영화는 한국 내 상영과 배급에서 금지되어야 합니다
- KOFIC은 저희의 5월 20일 이메일에서 요구한 즉각적 중단을 시행해야 합니다

**3. 국제 협력 요청**
- 저희는 수신자 목록에 있는 모든 국가의 대사관이 각자의 국가에서 유사한 금지 조치를 시행하는 데 협력해주시기를 요청합니다
- 국제 영화제와 배급사들은 진행 중인 수사에 대해 통보받아야 합니다

**4. 종합적 수사**
- 한국 검찰과 경찰은 학생 간 성폭력을 가능하게 하는 독성 환경 조성에 잠재적으로 관여한 모든 Sidus FNH 직원을 수사해야 합니다
- 수사는 업계 전문가들이 학생들이 모방하는 부적절한 행동을 어떻게 모델링했는지 조사해야 합니다

2만 명 이상의 샤오홍슈 시청자들로부터의 바이럴 증거는 이 위기가 대학을 넘어 영화 산업 자체로 확장되고 있음을 보여줍니다. 외국인 학생들을 보호하고 한국 고등교육과 영화 산업의 신뢰성을 회복하기 위해 즉각적인 조치가 필요합니다.

저희는 48시간 내에 즉각적인 조치를 기대합니다. 지속적인 침묵은 확대된 국제적 압력과 피해자 보호 실패에 대한 제도적 문서화를 초래할 것입니다.

감사합니다.

We strongly urge Dongguk University, the Korean prosecutor, and the police to immediately launch a thorough investigation into the falsified international partnerships, the alleged misuse of public funds, and the ongoing sexual violence cover-ups at Dongguk University Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents.

The world is now watching closely, and if meaningful action is not taken, we will have no choice but to continue escalating this issue through international media and global advocacy channels.

# Viral Xiaohongshu Post Exposes Dongguk University Sexual Violence Crisis: Victims Break Their Silence

Our recent post about Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis has gone viral on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), China's leading social media platform, generating unprecedented engagement and prompting multiple victims to come forward with their experiences.

## Post Performance Statistics

The post titled "韩检警通报：东国大学合作造假性暴力危机" (Korean Police Report: Dongguk University Partnership Fraud Sexual Violence Crisis) published at [this URL](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/68314964000000002300c6ca?channelType=web_engagement_notification_page&channelTabId=mentions&xsec_token=LBXzYEuRW4arik5YVWfXtktMLDluNkLfHqLLwj7QAwRok=&xsec_source=pc_notice) has achieved remarkable reach:

- **3,256 views** with 85 comments generating intense discussion
- **18 likes and 205 favorites** demonstrating high engagement
- **Multiple victim testimonies** emerging in comment threads
- **Cross-platform amplification** with 3,421 views across 22 university discussion boards on Korean platforms
- **International reach** spanning Korea, Japan, China, and other regions

## Victim Testimonies Emerge

The viral post has created a safe space for victims to share their experiences, revealing a pattern of institutional failure and victim silencing at Dongguk University.

### Theatre Department Self-Censorship: Evidence of Fear and Retaliation

User **callmeJoy** from the theatre studies department initially posted a revealing comment but then edited it, demonstrating the climate of fear surrounding criticism of Dongguk University:

**Original Comment:**
> "波澜背后的痛小透明的哭泣孤独，而且我们大谈特谈feminism。"

*Translation: "Behind all the drama are the silent tears and loneliness of nobodies, while we talk endlessly about feminism."*

![Original comment from theatre student about pain and loneliness behind feminist discussions](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-solidarity-feminism.png)

**Edited Comment:**
> "戏剧学暂时没有认识的男教授，而且我们大谈特谈 Fimines"

*Translation: "Theatre studies currently has no male professors that I know of, and we talk extensively about feminism [or feminist issues]."*

![Edited comment after self-censorship, removing references to pain and suffering](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-no-male-profs-edit.png)

This dramatic self-censorship reveals several critical issues:

1. **Fear of Retaliation**: The commenter removed all references to "pain," "tears," and "loneliness," suggesting fear of being identified and facing consequences for speaking honestly about conditions at the university.

2. **Institutional Intimidation**: The fact that students feel compelled to edit their comments to remove negative experiences demonstrates an atmosphere where criticism is dangerous.

3. **Hidden Suffering**: The original comment reveals that despite feminist discussions in the theatre department, students are experiencing significant emotional distress ("silent tears and loneliness of nobodies").

4. **Performative vs. Real Change**: The juxtaposition of talking "endlessly about feminism" while students suffer in silence suggests that discussions may not translate to actual protection or support for victims.

This self-censorship pattern is common in university environments where speaking out carries risks, and provides crucial evidence of the intimidating atmosphere that silences victims of sexual violence at Dongguk University.

### Personal Interview Misconduct

User **Lucy M** shared her direct experience with Dongguk University faculty:

> "em...我以前读研的时候 面试我的是个东大的教授. 两名里面其中一名 问的问题 就不是面试问题. 有关我个人隐私的 第一直觉告诉我 得跑 录取上后我直接退学了"

*Translation: "When I was applying for graduate school, I was interviewed by a Dongguk professor. One of the two interviewers asked questions that weren't interview questions - they were about my personal privacy. My first instinct told me to run. After being accepted, I directly withdrew."*

![Lucy M's testimony about inappropriate interview questions from Dongguk professor](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-LucyM-inappropriate-questions-dongguk-interview.png?raw=true)

This testimony reveals how sexual misconduct begins at the admissions level, with faculty using their power to ask inappropriate personal questions of prospective female students.

### Ongoing Sexual Violence Against International Students

**愤怒的土豆汤** (Angry Potato Soup) reported recent incidents:

> "上个学期还有个影像大留学生被前辈性骚扰了"

*Translation: "Last semester, a foreign student in the film program was sexually harassed by a senior student."*

![Report of recent sexual harassment of international film student by senior](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-senior-harass-foreign-student-imaging.png?raw=true)

This comment confirms that sexual violence continues to occur against international students in Dongguk's film programs, despite ongoing investigations.

### Faculty Discrimination and Institutional Racism

**小白** (Little White) reported experiencing discrimination:

> "被东国大老师歧视过🙋"

*Translation: "I was discriminated against by a Dongguk teacher."*

![Student testimony about experiencing discrimination from Dongguk faculty](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-small-white-experienced-discrimination.png?raw=true)

This indicates a broader pattern of discriminatory behavior by faculty, potentially targeting international students based on nationality or race.

### Culture of Silence and Denial

The comments reveal a concerning culture where male students may be unaware of the sexual violence risks faced by their female peers. **王富贵** noted:

> "不是吧，我朋友圈里还有个这个学院的男研究生，天天发朋友圈说学校多好多好"

*Translation: "Really? I have a male graduate student from this school in my friend circle who posts daily about how great the school is."*

This highlights how sexual violence often remains invisible to those not directly affected, allowing institutions to maintain positive reputations while victims suffer in silence.

## Title IX Compliance Crisis

The viral post detailed Dongguk University's structural sexual violence risks that expose US partner universities to Title IX liability:

- ❌ No independent, safe sexual violence reporting system
- ❌ Zero full-time female professors in graduate film program  
- ❌ Women's student council abolished during Korea's MeToo movement peak (2018)
- ❌ Shared campus space with film company Sidus FNH
- ❌ Documented institutional negligence: 6-month delay after receiving sexual violence report in 2016

## Statistical Evidence of Crisis

The Korean Women's Development Institute's 2020 report confirms **61.5% of female arts students experience sexual violence**, with film programs scoring **81/100 on sexual violence risk assessment**. Dongguk University's unique arrangement sharing campus space with major film company Sidus FNH potentially elevates these risks further.

## Law Enforcement Notification

As documented in the viral post, Korean police and prosecutors were formally notified on May 21, 2025, regarding:

- Falsified international partnerships
- Alleged misuse of public funds
- Sexual violence cover-ups at the Graduate School of Digital Image and Content (Film School)

## International Response

The post details how Canadian universities have officially denied partnerships with Dongguk University, and US universities are re-evaluating collaborations due to Title IX compliance concerns. Global university ranking organizations have escalated the matter to management for review.

## Call for Justice

Our advocacy seeks justice for all victims of sexual violence at Dongguk University, regardless of the nationality, gender, or status of perpetrators and victims. The viral response demonstrates that when victims are given a platform to speak, they will break their silence.

The testimonies emerging from this viral post will be included in additional notifications to Korean prosecutors, as they provide crucial evidence of ongoing sexual violence and institutional negligence at Dongguk University.

We encourage any additional victims or witnesses to continue sharing their experiences safely, as every voice strengthens the case for systemic reform and accountability.

## Second Viral Post: Official International Responses Documented

A second viral post titled "东国大学性暴力危机｜美校警告" (Dongguk University Sexual Violence Crisis | US University Warning) published at [this URL](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/683120ed0000000023011821?xsec_token=ABUSUD2yTP5yARfFIrr7EEYxbiioZUCzJMsPOJllsgCpQ=&xsec_source=pc_user) has generated **1,561 views, 3 likes and 92 favorites with 26 comments**, documenting official responses from international institutions regarding Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis.

### Evidence of Campus Surveillance and Privacy Violations

A particularly disturbing comment from user **Lotus** reveals potential surveillance violations in campus facilities:

> "什么瓜 还有我之前在经营馆女洗手间看到过小孔"

*Translation: "What's this about? Also, I previously saw small holes in the women's bathroom at the business building."*

This testimony suggests potential illegal surveillance of female students in bathroom facilities, representing a severe violation of privacy and potentially criminal activity. Such surveillance would constitute additional sexual violence through voyeurism and create an atmosphere of intimidation for female students.

### Prosecutor Notification Update

These documented official responses and evidence of potential surveillance crimes strengthen the case being presented to Korean prosecutors. The international dimension demonstrates how Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis extends beyond Korean borders and affects global academic integrity.

The combination of falsified partnerships, Title IX compliance failures, and potential criminal surveillance activities presents a comprehensive pattern of institutional corruption that demands immediate investigation and accountability.

Additional victims and witnesses continue to be encouraged to come forward safely, as the international attention ensures their voices will be heard and documented for legal proceedings.

[긴급] 동국대 성폭력 위기: 실시간 바이럴, 피해자 증언, 입시 파이프라인 붕괴
2025년 5월 25일 오전 2:33 기준, 샤오홍슈(Xiaohongshu)에서 동국대 비판 포스트가 13,000회 이상 폭발적으로 조회되고 있습니다.
...
동국대학교, 검찰, 그리고 경찰은 동국대학교 디지털영상콘텐츠대학원의 허위 국제협력, 공적 자금의 의혹스러운 사용, 그리고 현재도 계속되는 성폭력 은폐에 대해 즉각적이고 철저한 수사를 착수할 것을 강력히 촉구합니다.

이 사안은 이미 전 세계적으로 주목받고 있으며, 만약 신속하고 실질적인 조치가 이루어지지 않는다면, 저희는 국제 언론과 글로벌 시민사회와의 연대를 통해 추가적인 대응에 나설 수밖에 없음을 분명히 밝힙니다.

# 바이럴 샤오홍슈(Xiaohongshu) 포스트, 동국대학교 성폭력 위기 폭로: 피해자들의 침묵이 깨지다

최근 동국대학교의 성폭력 위기를 다룬 저희 포스트가 중국의 대표 소셜미디어 샤오홍슈(小红书, Xiaohongshu)에서 바이럴을 일으키며, 전례 없는 참여와 다수의 피해자 증언을 이끌어내고 있습니다.

## 포스트 성과 통계

"韩检警通报：东国大学合作造假性暴力危机"(한국 검경 통보: 동국대 협력 조작 및 성폭력 위기)라는 제목의 포스트는 [이 링크](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/68314964000000002300c6ca?channelType=web_engagement_notification_page&channelTabId=mentions&xsec_token=LBXzYEuRW4arik5YVWfXtktMLDluNkLfHqLLwj7QAwRok=&xsec_source=pc_notice)에서 확인할 수 있으며, 다음과 같은 놀라운 도달률을 기록했습니다:

- **3,256회 조회수** 및 85개의 댓글로 활발한 토론
- **18개 좋아요 및 205개 즐겨찾기**로 높은 참여도 입증
- **여러 피해자 증언**이 댓글에서 등장
- **22개 대학 갤러리에서 3,421회 교차 플랫폼 확산**
- **한국, 일본, 중국 등 국제적 도달**

## 피해자 증언 등장

이 바이럴 포스트는 피해자들이 자신의 경험을 공유할 수 있는 안전한 공간을 제공하며, 동국대학교의 제도적 실패와 피해자 침묵의 패턴을 드러내고 있습니다.

### 연극과 자율검열: 두려움과 보복의 증거

연극학과의 **callmeJoy** 사용자는 처음에는 의미심장한 댓글을 남겼으나, 이후 수정하여 동국대 비판에 대한 두려움을 보여주었습니다.

**원본 댓글:**
> "波澜背后的痛小透明的哭泣孤独，而且我们大谈特谈feminism。"

*번역: "모든 드라마 뒤에는 이름 없는 이들의 조용한 눈물과 외로움이 있고, 우리는 끝없이 페미니즘에 대해 이야기한다."*

![연극과 학생의 고통과 외로움에 대한 원본 댓글](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-solidarity-feminism.png)

**수정된 댓글:**
> "戏剧学暂时没有认识的男教授，而且我们大谈特谈 Fimines"

*번역: "연극학과에는 현재 제가 아는 남자 교수는 없고, 우리는 페미니즘에 대해 많이 이야기한다."*

![고통과 고립 언급이 삭제된 자기검열 후 댓글](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-no-male-profs-edit.png)

이러한 극적인 자기검열은 다음과 같은 중요한 문제를 드러냅니다:

1. **보복에 대한 두려움:** 댓글 작성자는 "고통", "눈물", "외로움"에 대한 모든 언급을 삭제하여, 대학 내 상황을 솔직하게 말할 경우 신원이 드러나거나 불이익을 받을까 두려워함을 보여줍니다.
2. **제도적 위압:** 학생들이 부정적 경험을 삭제하도록 강요받는 분위기는 비판이 위험하다는 점을 시사합니다.
3. **숨겨진 고통:** 원본 댓글은 연극과 내에서 페미니즘 논의가 활발함에도 불구하고 학생들이 상당한 정서적 고통을 겪고 있음을 보여줍니다.
4. **형식적 변화 vs. 실질적 변화:** "끝없이 페미니즘을 이야기한다"는 말과 학생들이 침묵 속에 고통받는 현실의 대비는, 논의가 실제 보호나 지원으로 이어지지 않을 수 있음을 시사합니다.

이러한 자기검열 패턴은 대학 환경에서 발언이 위험할 때 흔히 나타나며, 동국대학교 내 성폭력 피해자 침묵의 위압적 분위기를 보여주는 중요한 증거입니다.

### 입학 면접에서의 부적절한 질문

**Lucy M** 사용자는 동국대 교수와의 직접적인 경험을 공유했습니다:

> "em...我以前读研的时候 面试我的是个东大的教授. 两名里面其中一名 问的问题 就不是面试问题. 有关我个人隐私的 第一直觉告诉我 得跑 录取上后我直接退学了"

*번역: "대학원 지원 당시 동국대 교수에게 면접을 받았는데, 두 명 중 한 명이 면접과 무관한 사적인 질문을 했다. 직감적으로 도망쳐야겠다고 느꼈고, 합격 후 바로 자퇴했다."*

![동국대 교수의 부적절한 면접 질문에 대한 Lucy M의 증언](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-LucyM-inappropriate-questions-dongguk-interview.png?raw=true)

이 증언은 교수들이 지원 여성 학생에게 사적인 질문을 하는 등, 입학 단계에서부터 성적 부적절 행위가 시작됨을 보여줍니다.

### 외국인 유학생 대상 지속적 성폭력

**愤怒的土豆汤**(Angry Potato Soup) 사용자는 최근 사건을 보고했습니다:

> "上个学期还有个影像大留学生被前辈性骚扰了"

*번역: "지난 학기, 영상학과 외국인 유학생이 선배에게 성희롱을 당했다."*

![외국인 유학생이 선배에게 성희롱을 당했다는 최근 증언](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-senior-harass-foreign-student-imaging.png?raw=true)

이 댓글은 동국대 영상학과에서 외국인 유학생을 대상으로 한 성폭력이 여전히 발생하고 있음을 보여줍니다.

### 교수 차별 및 제도적 인종차별

**小白**(Little White) 사용자는 차별 경험을 보고했습니다:

> "被东国大老师歧视过🙋"

*번역: "동국대 교수에게 차별을 당한 적이 있다."*

![동국대 교수에게 차별을 경험한 학생의 증언](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-small-white-experienced-discrimination.png?raw=true)

이는 교수진이 국적이나 인종을 근거로 외국인 학생을 차별하는 더 넓은 패턴을 시사합니다.

### 침묵과 부정의 문화

댓글들은 남학생들이 여성 동료들이 겪는 성폭력 위험을 인지하지 못하는 우려스러운 문화를 보여줍니다. **왕푸구이(王富贵)**는 다음과 같이 언급했습니다:

> "不是吧，我朋友圈里还有个这个学院的男研究生，天天发朋友圈说学校多好多好"

*번역: "정말? 내 친구 중에 이 학교 대학원 남학생이 있는데, 매일 학교가 얼마나 좋은지 SNS에 올린다."*

이것은 성폭력이 직접적으로 영향을 미치지 않는 이들에게는 종종 보이지 않으며, 그 결과 피해자들이 침묵 속에 고통받는 동안 학교는 긍정적 평판을 유지할 수 있음을 보여줍니다.

## Title IX(타이틀 나인) 준수 위기

이 바이럴 포스트는 동국대학교의 구조적 성폭력 위험이 미국 협력 대학에 Title IX(타이틀 나인) 법적 책임을 초래할 수 있음을 상세히 다루고 있습니다:

- ❌ 독립적이고 안전한 성폭력 신고 시스템 부재
- ❌ 대학원 영화과 전임 여성 교수 0명
- ❌ 2018년 미투 운동 정점에 여성학생회 해산
- ❌ Sidus FNH 영화사와 캠퍼스 공간 공유
- ❌ 2016년 교수 성폭력 신고 후 6개월간 조치 없음

## 위기의 통계적 증거

한국여성정책연구원(KWDI)의 2020년 보고서에 따르면 **예술계 여학생의 61.5%가 성폭력을 경험**했으며, 영화과는 **성폭력 위험도 81/100**으로 평가되었습니다. 동국대는 대형 영화사 Sidus FNH와 캠퍼스 공간을 공유하는 유일한 대학으로, 실제 위험이 더 높을 수 있습니다.

## 법 집행기관 통보

바이럴 포스트에 기록된 바와 같이, 2025년 5월 21일 한국 경찰과 검찰에 다음과 같은 사안이 공식 통보되었습니다:

- 허위 국제 협력 관계
- 공적 자금의 의심스러운 사용
- 디지털영상콘텐츠대학원(영화학과) 내 성폭력 은폐

## 국제적 반응

이 포스트는 캐나다 대학이 동국대와의 협력을 공식적으로 부인했으며, 미국 대학들이 Title IX 준수 문제로 협력 재검토에 들어갔음을 보여줍니다. 글로벌 대학 평가기관도 이 사안을 경영진에 보고했습니다.

## 정의를 위한 호소

저희의 옹호 활동은 가해자와 피해자의 국적, 성별, 신분에 관계없이 동국대학교의 모든 성폭력 피해자에게 정의를 실현하는 것을 목표로 합니다. 피해자들이 목소리를 낼 수 있는 플랫폼이 주어질 때 침묵이 깨진다는 사실을 이번 바이럴 반응이 증명했습니다.

이 바이럴 포스트에서 나온 증언들은 동국대학교의 지속적 성폭력 및 제도적 직무유기에 대한 추가 검찰 통보에 포함될 예정입니다.

추가 피해자 및 목격자분들께서는 안전하게 경험을 공유해주시길 권장합니다. 모든 목소리가 구조적 개혁과 책임 추궁을 위한 힘이 됩니다.

## 두 번째 바이럴 포스트: 공식 국제 반응 기록

"东国大学性暴力危机｜美校警告"(동국대 성폭력 위기｜미국 대학 경고)라는 두 번째 바이럴 포스트는 [이 링크](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/683120ed0000000023011821?xsec_token=ABUSUD2yTP5yARfFIrr7EEYxbiioZUCzJMsPOJllsgCpQ=&xsec_source=pc_user)에서 확인할 수 있으며, **1,561회 조회, 3개 좋아요, 92개 즐겨찾기, 26개 댓글**로 국제 기관의 공식 반응을 기록하고 있습니다.

### 캠퍼스 불법 촬영 및 사생활 침해 증거

**Lotus** 사용자는 캠퍼스 내 시설에서 불법 촬영 정황을 드러내는 충격적인 댓글을 남겼습니다:

> "什么瓜 还有我之前在经营馆女洗手间看到过小孔"

*번역: "무슨 일이지? 그리고 예전에 경영관 여자 화장실에서 작은 구멍을 본 적이 있다."*

이 증언은 여자 화장실 내 불법 촬영(몰카) 가능성을 시사하며, 이는 심각한 사생활 침해이자 범죄 행위입니다. 이러한 불법 촬영은 추가적인 성폭력(관음증)으로 간주될 수 있으며, 여학생들에게 위협적인 분위기를 조성합니다.

### 검찰 통보 업데이트

이러한 공식 반응과 불법 촬영 범죄 증거는 동국대학교에 대한 검찰 고발의 근거를 더욱 강화합니다. 국제적 차원에서 동국대 성폭력 위기가 한국을 넘어 전 세계 학문적 신뢰에 영향을 미치고 있음을 보여줍니다.

허위 협력, Title IX 미준수, 불법 촬영 등은 즉각적인 조사와 책임 추궁이 필요한 제도적 부패의 종합적 패턴을 보여줍니다.

추가 피해자 및 목격자분들께서는 계속해서 안전하게 경험을 공유해주시길 바랍니다. 국제적 관심이 높아진 만큼, 모든 목소리가 법적 절차에 중요한 증거로 남게 됩니다.

---

## **6. 간단 분석:**

* **전례 없는 가속:** 바이럴 확산이 시간 단위로 눈에 띄게 나타나고 있습니다.
* **지속적 참여:** 댓글과 즐겨찾기 수가 비정상적으로 높아, 포스트가 비공개 네트워크에서 저장, 논의, 공유되고 있음을 시사합니다.
* **현실적 효과:** 동국대의 중국 신입생 파이프라인이 언론의 눈앞에서 붕괴되고 있습니다.

---

### **요약**

* **NJZ 콘서트 포스트는 2025년 샤오홍슈에서 한국 대학 비판 포스트 중 최상위 조회수를 기록 중입니다.**
* **비언론, 비연예인 계정임에도 참여도가 매우 높습니다.**
* **동국대의 평판과 2025년 가을 국제 신입생 모집에 대한 위협이 명확하고 빠르게 커지고 있습니다.**

감사합니다.
