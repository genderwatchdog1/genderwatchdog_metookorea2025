제목: 단독: 타이틀 IX 규정 준수 - 한국 대학의 국제적 위상에 대한 실존적 위협
Subject: EXCLUSIVE: Title IX Compliance - The Existential Threat to Korean Universities' International Standing

(English follows)

편집자님께,

미국 타이틀 IX 표준을 준수하지 않는 것이 한국 대학의 국제 파트너십과 유학생 유치 목표에 어떻게 심각한 영향을 미칠 수 있는지에 관한 긴급한 연구 결과를 공유하고자 합니다.

중요 발전 사항: 북미의 여러 대학과 주요 글로벌 대학 순위 기관이 구조적 성폭력 위험 요소에 관한 문서화된 우려에 따라 동국대학교와의 파트너십을 검토하기 시작했습니다. 이 발전은 한국의 고등 교육 부문, 특히 예술 프로그램에 더 광범위한 위협을 시사합니다.

파트너 기관의 응답 내용:
- 한 캐나다 대학은 동국대 웹사이트에 파트너로 등재되어 있음에도 불구하고 파트너십을 명시적으로 부인함
- 세 개의 미국 대학은 상황을 "검토", "내부적으로 논의", "처리"하기로 약속함
- 주요 글로벌 대학 순위 기관이 이 문제를 경영진에게 상정함

이러한 조치들은 적절한 성폭력 예방 조치와 성별 균형 잡힌 교수진 구조를 구현하지 못한 한국 기관들과의 국제 파트너십이 광범위하게 단절될 수 있는 시작을 나타냅니다.

왜 이것이 지금 중요한가:

1. 한국 정부는 2027년까지 30만 명의 외국 학생을 유치하겠다는 야심찬 목표를 설정했습니다. 이 목표는 우리의 옹호 네트워크가 다음과 같은 체계적인 접근을 시작함에 따라 실존적 위협에 직면합니다:
   - 타이틀 IX 관리자 협회(ATIXA)
   - 미국 고등 교육 기관 전반의 타이틀 IX 사무소
   - 캐나다, 유럽, 오세아니아의 유사한 규정 준수 기관

2. 2020년 한국여성정책연구원 보고서는 예술 교육 프로그램에서의 성폭력의 우려스러운 패턴을 문서화하며, 다음 사항을 강조합니다:
   - 남성 중심 교수진 구조가 권력 불균형을 초래함
   - "예술가-멘토" 관계가 일반적인 교육 경계를 넘어섬
   - 교수들이 업계 문지기 역할을 함으로써 취약성 형성
   - "예술적 표현"이 종종 부적절한 성적 행동을 정당화함

3. 동국대학교는 다음과 같은 구조적 문제를 보여줍니다:
   - 대학원 영화 프로그램의 모든 남성 교수진
   - 성폭력에 대한 가시적인 독립 보고 메커니즘 부재
   - 한국의 미투 운동 기간 중 여학생회 폐지
   - 상업 영화 단체(예: 시더스FNH)와 캠퍼스 공간 공유

4. 이러한 문제들은 2016년 이후 수많은 한국 예술 학계의 고위 프로필 사례와 연관됩니다:
   - 조민기 (청주대학교)
   - 이윤택 (국립극단)
   - 명지대학 연극학과
   - 한국예술종합학교
   - 서울예술대학
   - 서울시립대학교
   - 조재현 (경성대학교)

국제적 영향:

한국 대학들이 이러한 문제를 긴급히 해결하지 않으면, 우리는 다음과 같은 연쇄 효과를 예상합니다:
1. 미국 대학들은 타이틀 IX 책임 우려로 인해 파트너십을 종료할 것임
2. 캐나다, 유럽, 오세아니아 기관들이 뒤따를 것임
3. 이러한 서방 파트너십이 해체되면 아시아 대학들도 관계를 단절할 가능성이 높음
4. 중국 및 동남아시아 국가에서 오는 학생들의 파이프라인이 급속히 감소할 것임

기회의 창:

한국 대학들은 다음과 같은 중요하지만 짧은 기회에 직면해 있습니다:
1. 성별 균형을 달성하기 위한 교수진 구성 전면 개편
2. 투명한 성폭력 예방 및 보고 시스템 구현
3. 국제 표준을 충족하는 독립적인 감독 메커니즘 수립
4. 타이틀 IX 준수에 있어 경쟁 국가보다 앞서 위치하기

이는 한국 고등 교육에 도전과 기회를 동시에 제시합니다. 신속하게 행동하는 기관은 국제 학생 시장에서 차별화될 수 있지만, 지연하는 기관은 글로벌 위상에 영구적인 손상을 입을 위험이 있습니다.

이 발전 상황에 대해 더 자세히 논의할 기회를 환영합니다. 우리 단체는 기관 응답 사본, 전체 한국여성정책연구원 보고서 분석, 한국 예술 학계의 성폭력 사례 타임라인을 포함한 포괄적인 문서를 보유하고 있습니다.

감사합니다,

Subject: EXCLUSIVE: Title IX Compliance - The Existential Threat to Korean Universities' International Standing

Dear Editor,

I am writing to share urgent findings regarding how non-compliance with U.S. Title IX standards is poised to severely impact Korean universities' international partnerships and student recruitment goals.

CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT: Multiple North American universities and a major global university ranking organization have begun reviewing their partnerships with Dongguk University following documented concerns about structural sexual violence risk factors. This development signals a much broader threat to Korea's higher education sector, particularly in arts programs.

RESPONSES FROM PARTNER INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE:
- One Canadian university has explicitly denied having a partnership with Dongguk despite being listed on their website
- Three U.S. universities have committed to "review," "discuss internally," and "take care of" the situation
- A major global university ranking organization has escalated the issue to management

These actions indicate the beginning of what may become widespread severing of international partnerships with Korean institutions that fail to implement adequate sexual violence prevention measures and gender-balanced faculty structures.

WHY THIS MATTERS NOW:

1. The Korean government has set an ambitious goal to attract 300,000 foreign students by 2027. This goal faces an existential threat as our advocacy network has begun systematic outreach to:
   - Association of Title IX Administrators (ATIXA)
   - Title IX offices across U.S. higher education institutions
   - Similar compliance bodies in Canada, Europe, and Oceania

2. The 2020 Korean Women's Development Institute report documents alarming patterns of sexual violence in arts education programs, highlighting how:
   - Male-dominated faculty structures create power imbalances
   - "Artist-mentor" relationships extend beyond normal teaching boundaries
   - Professors serve as industry gatekeepers, creating vulnerability
   - "Artistic expression" often justifies inappropriate sexual behavior

3. Dongguk University exemplifies these structural problems with:
   - All-male faculty in the graduate film program
   - No visible independent reporting mechanisms for sexual violence
   - Abolishment of the Women's Student Council during Korea's MeToo movement
   - Shared campus space with commercial film entities (e.g., Sidus FNH)

4. These issues connect to a broader pattern in Korean arts academia, with numerous high-profile cases since 2016:
   - Jo Min-ki (Cheongju University)
   - Lee Yoon-taek (National Theatre Company)
   - Myongji College theater department
   - Korea National University of Arts
   - Seoul Institute of the Arts
   - University of Seoul
   - Cho Jae-hyun (Kyungsung University)

INTERNATIONAL IMPACT:

If Korean universities do not address these issues urgently, we anticipate a cascade effect:
1. U.S. universities will terminate partnerships due to Title IX liability concerns
2. Canadian, European, and Oceanian institutions will follow
3. Once these Western partnerships dissolve, Asian universities will likely sever ties
4. The pipeline of students from China and Southeast Asian countries will rapidly diminish

WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY:

Korean universities face a critical but brief opportunity to:
1. Overhaul faculty composition to achieve gender balance
2. Implement transparent sexual violence prevention and reporting systems
3. Establish independent oversight mechanisms that meet international standards
4. Position themselves ahead of competing countries in Title IX compliance

This represents both a challenge and an opportunity for Korean higher education. Institutions that act quickly could distinguish themselves in the international student market, while those that delay risk permanent damage to their global standing.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this developing situation in greater detail. Our organization has comprehensive documentation, including copies of institutional responses, the full KWDI report with analysis, and a timeline of sexual violence cases in Korean arts academia.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog Research Collective

안녕하세요.

현재 동국대학교의 영어 공식 웹사이트(👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554)에 명시된 국제 교류 대학 목록 중 캐나다 매니토바 대학교(University of Manitoba) 가 포함되어 있습니다.

2025년 4월 8일에 보관된 웹사이트:   https://web.archive.org/web/20250408154026/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

이에 대해 매니토바 대학교 국제처 담당자인 Kennis Fung 씨가 다음과 같은 공식 입장을 보내왔습니다. 아래 원문 이메일을 전달드리오니 참고해주시기 바랍니다.

"Dongguk University와의 학생 교류 협정은 없습니다.

그러므로 본교의 명칭을 보도자료 또는 미디어 커뮤니케이션에 포함시키지 말아주시기 바랍니다."

이는 동국대학교가 현재 국제 교류 협약 현황을 잘못 표기하거나 사실 확인 없이 외부에 홍보하고 있을 가능성을 시사합니다.

이와 같은 문제는 유학생 유치, 정부 지원금 배분, 대학 국제평가 지표 및 학생 보호정책의 투명성과도 깊이 연관되어 있으므로 관련 기관들의 조사가 필요하다고 판단됩니다.

Dear International Office,

I am writing to inform you of escalating gender equity and structural risk concerns at Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea — an institution
 publicly listed as one of your academic partners:

👉
https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

More than three weeks have passed since I first raised these issues directly with Dongguk University on March 14, 2025. An updated version of that
 report was subsequently circulated to other Asian partner institutions on March 15 to highlight potential risks affecting both domestic and international students, including exchange participants from North America.

As there has been no formal response from Dongguk University to date, I am following up with a consolidated summary of the most critical concerns.
 These include:

A persistent lack of gender diversity in faculty appointments (notably, an all-male graduate film program)
Heightened structural vulnerabilities due to the graduate school’s physical proximity to industry entities (e.g., Sidus FNH)
Ongoing gaps in curriculum transparency, student protections, and institutional accountability

1. 2016: Professor Replacement Policy

Dongguk introduced a progressive rule in 2016 allowing students to request a different professor if they experienced verbal or sexual abuse:

https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2016/08/05/socialAffairs/Dongguk-University-changes-policy-to-help-students-who-suffer-verbal-or-sexual-abuse/3022260.html

This was a promising step to address power imbalances in academia.

Questions:

Has any student successfully invoked this professor replacement policy?
Is the policy still actively enforced in 2025, particularly in the Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents?

2. 2018: MeToo Movement & Abolition of the Women’s Student Council

During the height of the MeToo movement in 2018, Dongguk abolished its Women’s Student Council — previously a key advocacy group for female students:

https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EB%8F%99%EA%B5%AD%EB%8C%80%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90%20%EC%B4%9D%EC%97%AC%ED%95%99%EC%83%9D%ED%9A%8C%20%ED%8F%90%EC%A7%80%20%EC%82%AC%EA%B1%B4

The above website may not be accessible from your location in which case, please download the website .html files and other files from
https://drive.proton.me/urls/C2MFHP3D9W#7SjZXGAORThC

Questions:

Why was this student-led body dismantled during a period of heightened global awareness around sexual harassment?
Has Dongguk created any alternative group or mechanism to protect and represent female students?

3. 2025: All-Male Faculty & Lack of Transparent Policies

As of 2025, the Master’s in Film program remains entirely male, according to Dongguk’s official site:

https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;

This creates significant power imbalances and raises the risk of unchecked misconduct. Contextual data includes:

Professors are often the main perpetrators of sexual abuse in Korean graduate schools

https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/06/181_309773.html

Korean universities grant excessive power to professors, increasing student vulnerability

Key Questions:

How does Dongguk justify having zero female faculty while claiming to uphold harassment prevention policies?
Without a Women’s Student Council, how can female or exchange students safely report misconduct?
Is the 2016 professor replacement policy still operational and publicly visible to students?

4. On-Campus Industry Exposure & Structural Vulnerabilities

It has come to light that Sidus FNH, one of Korea’s top film production companies, shares physical space with the graduate school program.

This shared space radically increases the risk of boundary violations, especially when:

Students and industry staff interact informally in elevators, cafeterias, or shared hallways
Students may feel pressure to network with powerful men who can influence their future employment
There is no formal oversight of these interactions, nor structured protections for students (e.g., chaperoning, reporting mechanisms, professional boundaries)

The risk for sexual harassment, inappropriate recruitment practices, and psychological grooming is exacerbated in environments where:

Young women are dependent on connections
All-male faculty reinforce hierarchical silence
Industry insiders walk freely among vulnerable students

This arrangement is not just negligent — it is dangerous.

Hoesik Risks:

Women in Korea are increasingly refusing to attend post-class or work drinking parties (hoesik) due to the risk of harassment:

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2900363
https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15546832

Yet without female faculty, ombudspersons, or safe reporting, students at Dongguk may feel pressured to attend these gatherings, particularly when linked to career advancement.

5. Institutional Inaction Despite Known Risk Factors

Combined with:

The dissolution of the Women’s Student Council in 2018
The lack of female faculty members
And the absence of transparency around sexual harassment reporting history

…it is clear that Dongguk University is failing to maintain basic gender equity safeguards in line with global academic and labor standards.

A growing body of international research confirms that gender-diverse faculties contribute to better outcomes for
all students — not just female or international learners. For reference, please see this report:
👉
https://drive.proton.me/urls/9GZC1335ZM#MyrCIqaix95o

6. Symbolic Curriculum Bias: French Over English

The program emphasizes French language, while offering no English-language training or support — despite English being the dominant language in global cinema:

English is used in international co-productions, global grants, and film festivals
Most international film industry networking, policy discourse, and distribution occurs in English

Questions:

Why is there no English-language component in the curriculum?
Does this decision reflect a male-centric fantasy about cinema rather than a practical learning objective?

This curriculum imbalance reflects:

Aesthetic elitism over employability
Coded masculinity hidden behind “taste” and “tradition”
Lack of commitment to real-world career preparation for both female and international students

7. "Policies Without Gender Balance Are Structural Performance, Not Protection"

Dongguk’s sexual harassment policy framework—while strong on paper—is structurally undermined by:

Zero female faculty
No women-led oversight
A dissolved student council
No published harassment data

As the Korean Women’s Association United has stated:

“Universities often establish sexual violence committees only as a formality — without transparency, accountability, or protection for victims.”

This is consistent with well-documented cases at Seoul National University, Yonsei, and Chung-Ang.

In this system:

Female students face retaliation and reputational risk for speaking up
International women may fear for visas, careers, or grades
Male professors are effectively unaccountable

These are not safeguards. These are institutional liabilities masquerading as ethics.

Requested Response

We respectfully request answers to the following:

Clarification on how the 2016 “professor replacement” policy is enforced in 2025.
Explanation for the abolition of the Women’s Student Council in 2018, and whether any replacement body exists.
What steps Dongguk is taking to address the all-male faculty composition in the Master’s in Film program.
What safeguards exist to prevent exploitation or harassment involving Sidus FNH collaborations.
Clarification on the curricular decision to prioritize French cinema while excluding English-language cinema.
Whether Dongguk maintains any harassment reporting data, and if so, whether it is publicly available.

Request for Accountability

We again urge:

Formal inquiry by partner institutions abroad
Suspension of academic partnerships with Dongguk University until gender equity reforms are implemented
Public disclosure of harassment reporting data and faculty gender balance over the last 5 years

Given the international community’s growing commitment to gender equality, we believe Dongguk University must clarify whether its policies, faculty structure, and academic culture
 meet global standards for a safe and inclusive educational environment.

We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog
