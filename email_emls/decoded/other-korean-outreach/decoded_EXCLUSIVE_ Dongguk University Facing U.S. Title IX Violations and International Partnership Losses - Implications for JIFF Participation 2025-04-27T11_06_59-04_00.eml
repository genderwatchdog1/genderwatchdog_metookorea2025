Subject: 독점: 동국대학교, 미국 타이틀 IX 규정 위반 및 국제 파트너십 상실 위기 - 전주국제영화제 참여에 영향 (EXCLUSIVE: Dongguk University Facing U.S. Title IX Violations and International Partnership Losses - Implications for JIFF Participation)

안녕하세요, 기자님,

전주국제영화제를 앞두고, 중요한 이슈를 공유하고자 합니다. 젠더워치독 리서치 콜렉티브(Gender Watchdog Research Collective)는 동국대학교 영화영상학과의 구조적인 성폭력 문제에 관한 광범위한 조사를 통해 심각한 우려사항을 확인했습니다. 이는 전주국제영화제에 참여하는 동국대학교 교수진과 관련하여 중요한 의미를 갖습니다.

주목할 만한 전개 사항은 동국대학교가 이미 국제적 파트너십과 평판에 손실을 경험하기 시작했다는 점입니다:

• 캐나다 대학 1곳이 이미 동국대학교와의 교류 협약 갱신을 거부
• 미국 대학 2곳이 현재 동국대학교와의 관계를 재평가 중
• 글로벌 대학 랭킹 기관이 이 문제를 경영진에게 보고하여 동국대학교의 국제 순위에 잠재적 영향 초래

이러한 국제적 반응은 미국의 타이틀 IX 규정과 직접적으로 연관되어 있습니다. 타이틀 IX는 미국 대학이 국제 파트너 기관에서도 성폭력 예방 및 대응에 있어 동등한 기준을 유지할 것을 요구합니다. 동국대학교의 현재 상황은 이러한 기준을 심각하게 위반하고 있어 미국 대학들이 법적 책임을 피하기 위해 파트너십을 재고하게 만들고 있습니다.

Dear Journalist,

As the Jeonju International Film Festival approaches, I am writing to share crucial information regarding a developing story with significant implications for Korea's international academic reputation. Gender Watchdog Research Collective has documented serious sexual violence issues within Dongguk University's film program that have begun to impact its global partnerships and standing.

BREAKING DEVELOPMENT: INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS DISTANCING FROM DONGGUK UNIVERSITY

Our investigation has confirmed that Dongguk University is already facing serious international consequences due to its documented failure to address sexual violence:

• One Canadian university has already declined to renew its exchange agreement with Dongguk University
• Two U.S. universities are currently re-evaluating their partnerships with Dongguk
• A global university rankings organization has escalated concerns to management level, potentially affecting Dongguk's international standing

These actions stem directly from Title IX obligations that require U.S. institutions to ensure international partner universities maintain comparable standards for preventing and addressing sexual violence. Dongguk's documented failures create potential legal liability for American partner institutions.

IMPLICATIONS FOR JEONJU INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL AND KOREA'S GLOBAL REPUTATION

The participation of Dongguk University faculty at JIFF raises significant questions about Korea's commitment to addressing sexual violence in the arts. International coverage of this issue could potentially impact:

• Korea's growing influence in global cinema and arts education
• The reputation of JIFF as a progressive, forward-thinking festival
• Perceptions of Korea's response to #MeToo concerns in academic and cultural spheres

KEY FINDINGS ON DONGGUK UNIVERSITY:

Our investigation has documented numerous institutional failures at Dongguk University:

• No visible, independent reporting system for sexual violence and sexual assault
• Zero full-time female faculty in the graduate film program
• Abolition of the Women's Student Council during the height of Korea's MeToo movement (2018)
• Shared campus space with commercial film entities, creating additional sexual violence risks
• Documented pattern of institutional negligence in responding to sexual assault cases:
  - Took no action for 6 months after being notified in February 2016 about a professor's sexual assault of a student
  - Only implemented a token "professor replacement policy" in August 2016, 9 months after the assault occurred
  - Failed to take disciplinary action against the professor until formal prosecution occurred

NATIONAL INTEREST ANGLE:

This story intersects with several important national interests:

1. Protection of Korea's growing international reputation in film and arts education
2. Ensuring Korean students are safe when studying at prestigious institutions
3. Maintaining valuable international partnerships with Western universities
4. Demonstrating Korea's commitment to addressing sexual violence in prestigious institutions

The growing international scrutiny of Dongguk University raises important questions about JIFF's decision to platform faculty from an institution that may soon face significant international isolation. As one of Korea's premier cultural events with global visibility, JIFF's association with Dongguk could potentially draw negative international press attention to Korea's arts sector.

We can provide additional documentation, data, and arrange interviews with experts. I'm available to discuss this developing story at [your contact information].

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog Research Collective
