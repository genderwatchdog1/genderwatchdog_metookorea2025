Dear Professional Standards Committee,

We are writing to report serious professional misconduct by Law Firm Shinwon (법무법인(유한)신원) and Attorney Baek Kyung-tae (ktpaek@lawsw.co.kr) involving frivolous legal threats that directly contradict easily verifiable evidence and constitute intimidation of sexual violence accountability advocates.

## Background: Sexual Violence Crisis and International Accountability Campaign

Our organization has been documenting systematic sexual violence at Dongguk University's Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents, where foreign women students have been subjected to predatory behavior by faculty and industry partners. Following 47 days of complete silence from Korean authorities despite formal reports to prosecutors and police, our campaign achieved viral status on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, generating over 26,000 views and prompting multiple victim testimonies.

The viral exposure revealed a disturbing pattern of institutional cover-up involving Dongguk University and its corporate partner Sidus Corporation, a Korean film production company that shares facilities with the university. According to Dongguk University's own official website, archived on April 14, 2025: "The department is located in the building, so-called 'Choong-Moo-Ro Yeong-Sang Center,' in which Sidus FNH, one of the top five film production companies in Korea, is based."

## Professional Misconduct by Law Firm Shinwon

Following our international distribution to 78 recipients including Korean prosecutors, embassies, and advocacy organizations, Sidus Corporation retained Law Firm Shinwon to send professional letterhead threats on May 27, 2025. Attorney Baek Kyung-tae sent official legal threats demanding immediate apology letters for "false information," complete retraction of all communications about the Dongguk relationship, and cessation of accountability advocacy under threat of legal action.

## Specific Professional Violations

### 1. Frivolous Legal Threats Contradicted by Archived Evidence
The law firm's threats directly contradict easily verifiable evidence from Dongguk University's own archived website. Their denial of the corporate-university facility-sharing relationship is contradicted by official university documentation stating that Sidus FNH operates in the same building as the film program.

### 2. Inadequate Due Diligence and Professional Competence
Document analysis reveals multiple indicators of rushed, inadequate legal preparation:
- PDF metadata shows anonymous authorship identified only as "20200609l" rather than proper attorney identification
- 24-hour turnaround from international exposure to legal threats suggests panic-driven response rather than careful legal analysis
- Factual claims easily contradicted by public records demonstrate failure to verify basic information
- Timeline inconsistencies regarding corporate history easily disproven by archived documentation

### 3. Client Counseling Failure
The legal strategy advised by Law Firm Shinwon made the situation significantly worse for their client by:
- Creating additional international scrutiny through diplomatic channels
- Providing evidence of retaliation culture that strengthens the case against systematic sexual violence
- Generating permanent documentation of corporate intimidation tactics
- Triggering additional bar association complaints and professional oversight

### 4. Intimidation of Sexual Violence Advocates
The firm used their professional status and letterhead to intimidate advocates documenting sexual violence against vulnerable foreign women students. This constitutes abuse of professional authority to silence accountability advocacy and protect institutions enabling systematic sexual violence.

### 5. International Incident Creation
The legal threats were sent in response to communications with 25+ embassies and international organizations, creating diplomatic pressure and international incidents through frivolous legal intimidation.

## Law Firm Contact Information

**Law Firm Shinwon (법무법인(유한)신원)**
- Address: 4th & 5th Floor, Hub One Building, 33 Seocho-daero 48-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul 06645
- Attorney: Baek Kyung-tae
- Email: ktpaek@lawsw.co.kr

## International Context and Diplomatic Consequences

The frivolous legal threats were sent in response to our international accountability campaign that simultaneously engaged:
- Korean law enforcement (prosecutors and police regarding sexual violence cover-ups)
- 25+ embassies (US, Canadian, Chinese, European missions)
- Global advocacy organizations (End Rape on Campus, RAINN, Title IX administrators)
- US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (Title IX compliance risks)
- International media (Reuters, BBC, Guardian, NPR, Financial Times)

The legal threats created additional diplomatic pressure and international incidents by attempting to intimidate advocates who had notified foreign embassies about sexual violence risks affecting their nationals studying in Korea.

## Professional Standards Implications

This case demonstrates how frivolous legal threats can:
- Backfire spectacularly by creating additional scrutiny and international pressure
- Provide evidence of consciousness of guilt and systematic retaliation culture
- Damage client interests through poor strategic judgment
- Abuse professional authority to intimidate sexual violence accountability advocates
- Create permanent professional liability through documented incompetence

The law firm's decision to send professional letterhead threats that directly contradict easily verifiable archived evidence represents a fundamental failure of professional judgment and due diligence that warrants disciplinary investigation.

## Request for Investigation

We respectfully request that your organization investigate this professional misconduct and consider appropriate disciplinary action against Law Firm Shinwon and Attorney Baek Kyung-tae. The documented evidence demonstrates clear violations of professional standards including:

1. Frivolous legal threats contradicted by public evidence
2. Inadequate due diligence and professional competence
3. Client counseling failure resulting in worse outcomes
4. Intimidation of sexual violence accountability advocates
5. International incident creation through diplomatic pressure

The legal profession's integrity depends on maintaining standards that prevent abuse of professional authority to silence accountability advocacy and protect institutions enabling systematic sexual violence against vulnerable students.

## Broader Implications for Legal Profession

This case provides an important opportunity for the legal profession to demonstrate that professional letterhead and legal threats cannot be used to intimidate advocates documenting sexual violence, particularly when such threats contradict easily verifiable evidence and create international diplomatic incidents.

The permanent preservation of these frivolous legal threats in international archives ensures that this case will serve as either a positive example of professional accountability or a negative example of how legal intimidation can backfire when used inappropriately.

We encourage your organization to preserve these documents as evidence of professional misconduct and consider this case in developing guidance for legal professionals regarding crisis communications and the appropriate use of legal threats.

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter of professional standards and accountability. The legal profession's response will determine whether professional authority can be abused to silence sexual violence accountability advocacy or whether appropriate standards are maintained to protect vulnerable victims and advocates.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog Research Collective
