Dear International Office,

Apologies for resending this message, but due to the sensitivity and seriousness of this being a Title IX compliance issue, I wanted to ensure that the information is immediately visible and not inadvertently collapsed in your email client.

Please read the email chain below, which outlines the current gender equity and institutional safety problems at your academic partner in South Korea, Dongguk University.

Dear International Office,

I am writing to inform you of escalating gender equity and structural risk concerns at Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea — an institution publicly listed as one of your academic partners:  
👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

More than three weeks have passed since I first raised these issues directly with Dongguk University on March 14, 2025. An updated version of that report was subsequently circulated to other Asian partner institutions on March 15 to highlight potential risks affecting both domestic and international students, including exchange participants from North America.

We are concerned that continuing exchange relations with Dongguk University may expose your institution to **Title IX non-compliance liability**, given that the host environment for graduate film students **lacks fundamental safeguards** for gender equity and harassment prevention.

Dongguk’s Master’s in Film program is **exclusively male-led**, situated in **physical proximity to entertainment industry actors**, and lacks a functioning **Women’s Student Council**. This constellation of factors raises **material risk for U.S. students**, particularly women, who may be placed into an environment with **no institutional protections, no female faculty**, and **elevated vulnerability to grooming, harassment, or coercion**.

Furthermore, even outside the film school, Dongguk’s **undergraduate and graduate programs in Buddhist Studies** — despite the university’s religious origins — also exhibit a **predominantly male faculty structure**, as publicly listed here:  
👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/21

This raises reasonable concerns that other faculties at Dongguk may share **structural gender equity deficiencies**, creating a broader institutional risk pattern.

As there has been no formal response from Dongguk University to date, I am now following up with a consolidated summary of the most critical concerns. These include:

- A persistent lack of gender diversity in faculty appointments (notably, an all-male graduate film program)
- Heightened structural vulnerabilities due to the graduate school’s physical proximity to industry entities (e.g., Sidus FNH)
- Ongoing gaps in curriculum transparency, student protections, and institutional accountability

1. 2016: Professor Replacement Policy

Dongguk introduced a progressive rule in 2016 allowing students to request a different professor if they experienced verbal or sexual abuse:

https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2016/08/05/socialAffairs/Dongguk-University-changes-policy-to-help-students-who-suffer-verbal-or-sexual-abuse/3022260.html

This was a promising step to address power imbalances in academia.

Questions:

Has any student successfully invoked this professor replacement policy?

Is the policy still actively enforced in 2025, particularly in the Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents?2. 2018: MeToo Movement & Abolition of the Women’s Student Council

During the height of the MeToo movement in 2018, Dongguk abolished its Women’s Student Council — previously a key advocacy group for female students:

The above website may not be accessible from your location in which case, please download the website .html files and other files from https://drive.proton.me/urls/C2MFHP3D9W#7SjZXGAORThC

Questions:

Why was this student-led body dismantled during a period of heightened global awareness around sexual harassment?

Has Dongguk created any alternative group or mechanism to protect and represent female students?3. 2025: All-Male Faculty & Lack of Transparent Policies

As of 2025, the Master’s in Film program remains entirely male, according to Dongguk’s official site:

https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;

This creates significant power imbalances and raises the risk of unchecked misconduct. Contextual data includes:

Professors are often the main perpetrators of sexual abuse in Korean graduate schools

Korean universities grant excessive power to professors, increasing student vulnerability

Key Questions:

How does Dongguk justify having zero female faculty while claiming to uphold harassment prevention policies?

Without a Women’s Student Council, how can female or exchange students safely report misconduct?

Is the 2016 professor replacement policy still operational and publicly visible to students?4. On-Campus Industry Exposure & Structural Vulnerabilities

It has come to light that Sidus FNH, one of Korea’s top film production companies, shares physical space with the graduate school program.

This shared space radically increases the risk of boundary violations, especially when:

Students and industry staff interact informally in elevators, cafeterias, or shared hallways

Students may feel pressure to network with powerful men who can influence their future employment

There is no formal oversight of these interactions, nor structured protections for students (e.g., chaperoning, reporting mechanisms, professional boundaries)

The risk for sexual harassment, inappropriate recruitment practices, and psychological grooming is exacerbated in environments where:

Young women are dependent on connections

All-male faculty reinforce hierarchical silence

Industry insiders walk freely among vulnerable students

This arrangement is not just negligent — it is dangerous.

Hoesik Risks:
Women in Korea are increasingly refusing to attend post-class or work drinking parties (hoesik) due to the risk of harassment:

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2900363

https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15546832

Yet without female faculty, ombudspersons, or safe reporting, students at Dongguk may feel pressured to attend these gatherings, particularly when linked to career advancement.5. Institutional Inaction Despite Known Risk Factors

Combined with:

The dissolution of the Women’s Student Council in 2018

The lack of female faculty members

And the absence of transparency around sexual harassment reporting history

…it is clear that Dongguk University is failing to maintain basic gender equity safeguards in line with global academic and labor standards.

A growing body of international research confirms that gender-diverse faculties contribute to better outcomes for all students — not just female or international learners. For reference, please see this report: 👉 https://drive.proton.me/urls/9GZC1335ZM#MyrCIqaix95o6. Symbolic Curriculum Bias: French Over English

The program emphasizes French language, while offering no English-language training or support — despite English being the dominant language in global cinema:

English is used in international co-productions, global grants, and film festivals

Most international film industry networking, policy discourse, and distribution occurs in English

Questions:

Why is there no English-language component in the curriculum?

Does this decision reflect a male-centric fantasy about cinema rather than a practical learning objective?

This curriculum imbalance reflects:

Aesthetic elitism over employability

Coded masculinity hidden behind “taste” and “tradition”

Lack of commitment to real-world career preparation for both female and international students7. "Policies Without Gender Balance Are Structural Performance, Not Protection"

Dongguk’s sexual harassment policy framework—while strong on paper—is structurally undermined by:

Zero female faculty

No women-led oversight

A dissolved student council

No published harassment data

As the Korean Women’s Association United has stated:

“Universities often establish sexual violence committees only as a formality — without transparency, accountability, or protection for victims.”

This is consistent with well-documented cases at Seoul National University, Yonsei, and Chung-Ang.

In this system:

Female students face retaliation and reputational risk for speaking up

International women may fear for visas, careers, or grades

Male professors are effectively unaccountable

These are not safeguards. These are institutional liabilities masquerading as ethics.Requested Response

We respectfully request answers to the following:

Clarification on how the 2016 “professor replacement” policy is enforced in 2025.

Explanation for the abolition of the Women’s Student Council in 2018, and whether any replacement body exists.

What steps Dongguk is taking to address the all-male faculty composition in the Master’s in Film program.

What safeguards exist to prevent exploitation or harassment involving Sidus FNH collaborations.

Clarification on the curricular decision to prioritize French cinema while excluding English-language cinema.

Whether Dongguk maintains any harassment reporting data, and if so, whether it is publicly available.Request for Accountability

We again urge:

Formal inquiry by partner institutions abroad

Suspension of academic partnerships with Dongguk University until gender equity reforms are implemented

Public disclosure of harassment reporting data and faculty gender balance over the last 5 years

Given the international community’s growing commitment to gender equality, we believe Dongguk University must clarify whether its policies, faculty structure, and academic culture meet global standards for a safe and inclusive educational environment.

We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Gender Watchdog
