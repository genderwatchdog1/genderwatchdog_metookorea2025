안녕하세요.

현재 동국대학교의 영어 공식 웹사이트(👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554)에 명시된 국제 교류 대학 목록 중 캐나다 매니토바 대학교(University of Manitoba) 가 포함되어 있습니다.

2025년 4월 8일에 보관된 웹사이트:   https://web.archive.org/web/20250408154026/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

이에 대해 매니토바 대학교 국제처 담당자인 Kennis Fung 씨가 다음과 같은 공식 입장을 보내왔습니다. 아래 원문 이메일을 전달드리오니 참고해주시기 바랍니다.

"Dongguk University와의 학생 교류 협정은 없습니다.

그러므로 본교의 명칭을 보도자료 또는 미디어 커뮤니케이션에 포함시키지 말아주시기 바랍니다."

이는 동국대학교가 현재 국제 교류 협약 현황을 잘못 표기하거나 사실 확인 없이 외부에 홍보하고 있을 가능성을 시사합니다.

이와 같은 문제는 유학생 유치, 정부 지원금 배분, 대학 국제평가 지표 및 학생 보호정책의 투명성과도 깊이 연관되어 있으므로 관련 기관들의 조사가 필요하다고 판단됩니다.

Subject: [Reference] Forwarding Clarification Email from University of Manitoba (Listed on Dongguk’s Partner Page)

Dear officials,

I am writing to share a clarification received from Kennis Fung, an official at the University of Manitoba in Canada, which is currently listed on Dongguk University’s international exchange webpage (👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554).

archived website (April 8, 2025):

The University of Manitoba has formally stated:

“We do not have a student exchange agreement with Dongguk University.

Please do NOT include our institution in the article or in communications with any journalists or media.”

This statement raises serious concerns that Dongguk University may be misrepresenting or inaccurately maintaining its international partnerships.

Such misrepresentation affects not only student safety and institutional transparency but also international rankings, recruitment, and government-linked program funding. I am forwarding the original email from Kennis Fung below for your reference.

Further background on the gender equity issues and structural risks at Dongguk University can be found at: 👉 https://genderwatchdog.bearblog.dev

Dear International Office,

I am writing to inform you of escalating gender equity and structural risk concerns at Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea — an institution
 publicly listed as one of your academic partners:

👉
https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

More than three weeks have passed since I first raised these issues directly with Dongguk University on March 14, 2025. An updated version of that
 report was subsequently circulated to other Asian partner institutions on March 15 to highlight potential risks affecting both domestic and international students, including exchange participants from North America.

As there has been no formal response from Dongguk University to date, I am following up with a consolidated summary of the most critical concerns.
 These include:

A persistent lack of gender diversity in faculty appointments (notably, an all-male graduate film program)
Heightened structural vulnerabilities due to the graduate school’s physical proximity to industry entities (e.g., Sidus FNH)
Ongoing gaps in curriculum transparency, student protections, and institutional accountability

1. 2016: Professor Replacement Policy

Dongguk introduced a progressive rule in 2016 allowing students to request a different professor if they experienced verbal or sexual abuse:

https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2016/08/05/socialAffairs/Dongguk-University-changes-policy-to-help-students-who-suffer-verbal-or-sexual-abuse/3022260.html

This was a promising step to address power imbalances in academia.

Questions:

Has any student successfully invoked this professor replacement policy?
Is the policy still actively enforced in 2025, particularly in the Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents?

2. 2018: MeToo Movement & Abolition of the Women’s Student Council

During the height of the MeToo movement in 2018, Dongguk abolished its Women’s Student Council — previously a key advocacy group for female students:

https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EB%8F%99%EA%B5%AD%EB%8C%80%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90%20%EC%B4%9D%EC%97%AC%ED%95%99%EC%83%9D%ED%9A%8C%20%ED%8F%90%EC%A7%80%20%EC%82%AC%EA%B1%B4

The above website may not be accessible from your location in which case, please download the website .html files and other files from
https://drive.proton.me/urls/C2MFHP3D9W#7SjZXGAORThC

Questions:

Why was this student-led body dismantled during a period of heightened global awareness around sexual harassment?
Has Dongguk created any alternative group or mechanism to protect and represent female students?

3. 2025: All-Male Faculty & Lack of Transparent Policies

As of 2025, the Master’s in Film program remains entirely male, according to Dongguk’s official site:

https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;

This creates significant power imbalances and raises the risk of unchecked misconduct. Contextual data includes:

Professors are often the main perpetrators of sexual abuse in Korean graduate schools

https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/06/181_309773.html

Korean universities grant excessive power to professors, increasing student vulnerability

Key Questions:

How does Dongguk justify having zero female faculty while claiming to uphold harassment prevention policies?
Without a Women’s Student Council, how can female or exchange students safely report misconduct?
Is the 2016 professor replacement policy still operational and publicly visible to students?

4. On-Campus Industry Exposure & Structural Vulnerabilities

It has come to light that Sidus FNH, one of Korea’s top film production companies, shares physical space with the graduate school program.

This shared space radically increases the risk of boundary violations, especially when:

Students and industry staff interact informally in elevators, cafeterias, or shared hallways
Students may feel pressure to network with powerful men who can influence their future employment
There is no formal oversight of these interactions, nor structured protections for students (e.g., chaperoning, reporting mechanisms, professional boundaries)

The risk for sexual harassment, inappropriate recruitment practices, and psychological grooming is exacerbated in environments where:

Young women are dependent on connections
All-male faculty reinforce hierarchical silence
Industry insiders walk freely among vulnerable students

This arrangement is not just negligent — it is dangerous.

Hoesik Risks:

Women in Korea are increasingly refusing to attend post-class or work drinking parties (hoesik) due to the risk of harassment:

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2900363
https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15546832

Yet without female faculty, ombudspersons, or safe reporting, students at Dongguk may feel pressured to attend these gatherings, particularly when linked to career advancement.

5. Institutional Inaction Despite Known Risk Factors

Combined with:

The dissolution of the Women’s Student Council in 2018
The lack of female faculty members
And the absence of transparency around sexual harassment reporting history

…it is clear that Dongguk University is failing to maintain basic gender equity safeguards in line with global academic and labor standards.

A growing body of international research confirms that gender-diverse faculties contribute to better outcomes for
all students — not just female or international learners. For reference, please see this report:
👉
https://drive.proton.me/urls/9GZC1335ZM#MyrCIqaix95o

6. Symbolic Curriculum Bias: French Over English

The program emphasizes French language, while offering no English-language training or support — despite English being the dominant language in global cinema:

English is used in international co-productions, global grants, and film festivals
Most international film industry networking, policy discourse, and distribution occurs in English

Questions:

Why is there no English-language component in the curriculum?
Does this decision reflect a male-centric fantasy about cinema rather than a practical learning objective?

This curriculum imbalance reflects:

Aesthetic elitism over employability
Coded masculinity hidden behind “taste” and “tradition”
Lack of commitment to real-world career preparation for both female and international students

7. "Policies Without Gender Balance Are Structural Performance, Not Protection"

Dongguk’s sexual harassment policy framework—while strong on paper—is structurally undermined by:

Zero female faculty
No women-led oversight
A dissolved student council
No published harassment data

As the Korean Women’s Association United has stated:

“Universities often establish sexual violence committees only as a formality — without transparency, accountability, or protection for victims.”

This is consistent with well-documented cases at Seoul National University, Yonsei, and Chung-Ang.

In this system:

Female students face retaliation and reputational risk for speaking up
International women may fear for visas, careers, or grades
Male professors are effectively unaccountable

These are not safeguards. These are institutional liabilities masquerading as ethics.

Requested Response

We respectfully request answers to the following:

Clarification on how the 2016 “professor replacement” policy is enforced in 2025.
Explanation for the abolition of the Women’s Student Council in 2018, and whether any replacement body exists.
What steps Dongguk is taking to address the all-male faculty composition in the Master’s in Film program.
What safeguards exist to prevent exploitation or harassment involving Sidus FNH collaborations.
Clarification on the curricular decision to prioritize French cinema while excluding English-language cinema.
Whether Dongguk maintains any harassment reporting data, and if so, whether it is publicly available.

Request for Accountability

We again urge:

Formal inquiry by partner institutions abroad
Suspension of academic partnerships with Dongguk University until gender equity reforms are implemented
Public disclosure of harassment reporting data and faculty gender balance over the last 5 years

Given the international community’s growing commitment to gender equality, we believe Dongguk University must clarify whether its policies, faculty structure, and academic culture
 meet global standards for a safe and inclusive educational environment.

We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog
