Dear Taehee Lee,

I am writing to formally report a concern about a potential misrepresentation on Dongguk University’s official English-language website regarding international exchange partnerships.

As of April 9, 2025, Dongguk University continues to list numerous North American and Asian institutions as exchange partners at the following URL:  
👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

archived on April 8, 2025: 
https://web.archive.org/web/20250408154026/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

However, **one Canadian university** named on that page has **formally denied** any existing exchange agreement with Dongguk and has explicitly requested **not to be identified publicly** in any press coverage or external media. Their official message stated:

Hello,

We do not have a student exchange agreement with Dongguk University.  As a result, please DO NOT include our institution in the article and when you communicate with any journalists or media.

Despite this, Dongguk University continues to list the school as a partner, raising serious concerns that the university may be **misrepresenting its international affiliations**—intentionally or through negligence—to bolster its academic reputation.

This misrepresentation could impact:
- Government funding and internationalization grants,
- Overseas student recruitment,
- International university rankings and QS metrics,
- Legal and ethical obligations tied to student safety.

The program of greatest concern is Dongguk’s **Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents**, which exhibits:
- An **entirely male faculty**,  
- Physical proximity to the private film company **Sidus FNH**,  
- The **abolition of its Women’s Student Council** in 2018,  
- A lack of independent **reporting mechanisms for harassment**.

International media and academic institutions have been notified. **Please find the full email chain below**, which includes the Canadian university's clarification (with identifiers redacted), and verify whether Dongguk’s partnership disclosures and academic structures meet Korean education and gender equity standards.

안녕하십니까,

본 메일은 동국대학교(서울) 영어 공식 웹사이트에 명시된 국제 교류 대학 목록(👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554) 중 일부가 사실과 다를 수 있다는 점을 공식적으로 보고하고자 합니다.

2025년 4월 현재, 동국대학교는 다수의 북미, 유럽, 아시아 대학들을 학생 교류 파트너로 공개적으로 표기하고 있으나, 그 중 한 **캐나다 소재 대학**은 최근 다음과 같이 명확히 밝혔습니다:

> “Dongguk University와의 학생 교류 협정은 없습니다. 그러므로 본교의 명칭을 보도자료 또는 미디어 커뮤니케이션에 포함시키지 말아주시기 바랍니다.”

해당 학교는 **미디어 또는 외부 공개 시 자교의 이름을 거론하지 말아 달라고 명시적으로 요청하였습니다**. 그러나, 동국대학교는 여전히 해당 대학을 공식 교류 파트너 목록에 포함시키고 있습니다.

이로 인해, 동국대학교가 국제 협력 현황을 **허위로 기재하거나 관리되지 않은 상태로 홍보하고 있을 가능성**이 제기되고 있으며, 이는 다음과 같은 중요 분야에 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다:
- 정부 및 공공기관 대상 국제화 성과 보고
- 해외 유학생 유치 및 장학 지원
- 대학평가 및 QS 세계랭킹
- 학생 안전 보장 및 교환 프로그램의 법적 책임성

특히 문제가 되는 것은 동국대 **디지털영상콘텐츠대학원** 과정입니다. 해당 대학원은 다음과 같은 구조적 위험요소를 포함하고 있습니다:

- 교수진 전원이 남성
- 민간 영화제작사 Sidus FNH와 건물 공유
- 2018년 총여학생회 폐지 이후 대체 기구 없음
- 성희롱·권력형 학대에 대한 독립적 신고 체계 부재

이와 같은 문제로 인해 **해외 언론 보도**와 **국제 파트너 기관 대상 알림**이 진행되고 있으며, 국내 교육정책 기관의 **즉각적인 사실 확인 및 제도적 대응**이 필요한 상황입니다.

📎 해당 캐나다 대학과의 이메일 교신 원문은 아래 이메일 체인에 첨부되어 있습니다 (성명은 익명 처리됨).

        Subject: “Are Canadian Universities Sending Students Into Danger? The Scandal Brewing at Korea’s Top Film School”

        To: cbcnewsvancouver@cbc.ca 

Korean film and television enjoy enormous popularity across Canada and worldwide—but behind the global prestige lies a growing scandal. One of Korea’s most elite graduate film schools, Dongguk University in Seoul, is now under scrutiny for its structural risk factors for sexual harassment—and several Canadian universities are still listed as official exchange partners.

At the heart of the problem is Dongguk’s Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents, a program that:

Has zero female faculty as of 2025,

Shares building space with powerful private film companies (notably Sidus FNH),

Abolished its Women’s Student Council in 2018 during the peak of the MeToo movement,

Offers no independent reporting mechanism for sexual harassment or academic abuse.

These conditions—combined with a male-dominated graduate hierarchy and informal contact with film industry insiders—create what gender watchdogs call one of the highest-risk educational environments in the developed world.

Yet Dongguk University continues to list Canadian partner institutions on its official site:

👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

In at least one case, a Canadian university’s international office has denied having any current agreement, suggesting Dongguk may be misrepresenting the extent of its global affiliations.

When formally notified of these concerns, Dongguk’s only response was:

“For what purpose did you send the e-mail? Is it for suggestion or reporting?”

This reply—sent by their international office—raises alarm not only about institutional awareness but also about the safety of Canadian students currently abroad or preparing to go.

While Canada has no exact equivalent to the U.S. Title IX law, which legally binds American schools to safeguard students in overseas programs, the ethical standard remains the same: Canadian institutions are responsible for ensuring students are not placed in gender-unsafe environments.

Furthermore, according to the Korean Women’s Development Institute’s post-MeToo study (“University Students in the Culture and Arts after the MeToo Movement”), Korean universities often operate tokenistic reporting systems that retraumatize survivors. Graduate schools in the arts—especially those tied to the film industry—are cited as the most dangerous for female students.

Dongguk University’s Buddhist branding and elite status only compound the contradictions. How can a school that claims to promote ethical values operate without any gender parity or transparency? And why are Canadian universities still associating their names with it?

📎 A full timeline, screenshots, references, and Dongguk’s reply are available at:

We believe The Fifth Estate is uniquely positioned to investigate this as a Canadian public interest story—not just about a Korean institution, but about Canadian complicity in global gender inequity through unvetted academic partnerships.Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog
