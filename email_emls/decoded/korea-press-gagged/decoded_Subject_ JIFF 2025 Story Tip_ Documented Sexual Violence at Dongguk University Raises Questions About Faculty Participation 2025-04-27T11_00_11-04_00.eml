Dear Film Journalist,

With the Jeonju International Film Festival approaching, I'm writing on behalf of Gender Watchdog Research Collective to share documented information about sexual violence at Dongguk University that may be relevant to your festival coverage. This story intersects with current industry conversations about safety, accountability, and institutional reform in film education.

STORY ANGLE: JIFF PLATFORM FOR FACULTY FROM INSTITUTION WITH DOCUMENTED SEXUAL VIOLENCE

Dongguk University faculty members are scheduled to participate in this year's festival panels, despite the institution's documented pattern of sexual violence and failure to implement adequate safety measures for students. This raises important questions about the responsibility of film festivals when providing platforms to representatives from problematic institutions.

KEY FINDINGS ON DONGGUK UNIVERSITY:

Our research has documented systemic sexual violence within Dongguk University's graduate film program, including:

• Zero full-time female faculty in the graduate film program
• Abolition of the Women's Student Council during the height of Korea's MeToo movement (2018)
• No visible, independent reporting system for sexual violence and sexual assault
• Shared campus space with commercial film entities (e.g., Sidus FNH), blurring lines between academic authority and industry power dynamics
• Documented pattern of institutional negligence in responding to sexual assault cases, including a 2016 case where:
  - The university took no action for 6 months after being notified about a professor's sexual assault of a student
  - Only implemented a token "professor replacement policy" 9 months after the assault occurred
  - Failed to take disciplinary action against the professor until formal prosecution occurred

BROADER CONTEXT: SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN KOREAN FILM EDUCATION

This case exists within a documented pattern of sexual violence in Korean arts academia, which received international attention during the 2018 #MeToo movement but remains inadequately addressed. Notable cases include:

• Jo Min-ki (Cheongju University): Actor and professor faced multiple allegations of sexually abusing students, later died by suicide
• Lee Yoon-taek (National Theatre Company): Prominent theatre director convicted of sexually assaulting nine women under the guise of acting lessons
• Cho Jae-hyun (Kyungsung University): Actor and professor resigned after allegations of sexual violence from students

POTENTIAL INTERVIEW SOURCES:

• Korean Women's Development Institute researchers who documented patterns of sexual violence in arts education
• International film school administrators implementing stronger protections
• Advocates working on reform of abuse prevention in arts education

VISUAL ELEMENTS AVAILABLE:

• Timeline visualization of Dongguk University cases
• Infographics on sexual violence patterns in Korean arts education
• Statistics on gender imbalance in film faculty representation

This story provides your readers important context about the intersection of film education, institutional accountability, and festival ethics. It examines whether festivals have a responsibility to consider documented sexual violence when platforming representatives from implicated institutions.

We can provide additional documentation, data, and arrange interviews with experts and advocates. I'm available for further discussion about this story angle at [your contact information].

For immediate review, our documentation is available at: https://genderwatchdog1.github.io/timeline-website/index.html

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog Research Collective
