To the Editorial or Investigative Desk,

Following up on our March 2025 communication regarding serious structural and ethical concerns at Dongguk University (Seoul), we are writing to provide confirmed documentation that substantiates our original concerns regarding false partnership claims and institutional risk concealment.üîé üîç NEW DEVELOPMENTS:

We have contacted several foreign institutions listed as "partners" on Dongguk‚Äôs official English website (https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554). Two of these institutions have officially denied any such partnership or announced a review:

üá®üá¶ Canadian university:
‚ÄúWe do not have a student exchange agreement with Dongguk University. As a result, please DO NOT include our institution in the article and when you communicate with any journalists or media.‚Äù

üá∫üá∏ American university:
‚ÄúWe are undergoing a review of all of our exchange partners and will take this into consideration‚Ä¶ Please do not quote me in any articles or further emails.‚Äù

üîó Screenshots of the email responses are available here:
https://drive.proton.me/urls/95J0T3K37R#RBCO657BAC6a

(also attached)

This raises serious concerns of institutional misrepresentation, which may mislead international applicants, affect university rankings, and violate the ethical norms of global academic transparency.üéì SEXUAL VIOLENCE RISK CONTEXT:

As previously reported, Dongguk‚Äôs film master's program continues to exhibit high-risk characteristics:

All-male faculty (as of April 2025)

No visible reporting mechanism for sexual harassment

Physical co-location with major commercial film companies

Abolition of the Women‚Äôs Student Council during the #MeToo period

This risk is consistent with research:

üü• According to a 2023 study by Lee, Moon, & Na-Young Lee, 49.67% of women in the Korean film industry reported experiencing workplace sexual harassment.

Women with a master‚Äôs degree or higher were more than 3 times as likely to be harassed.

üî¢ A 2019 Korean Film Council survey reported:

74.6% of women in the film industry experienced sexual harassment or violence during their career

Most incidents occurred at drinking gatherings, on set, or during production stages
Full source: https://drive.proton.me/urls/GXRANHYYJC#fz0SipRRWdaF

üì£ REQUEST TO PRESS:

We urge Korean media to:

Investigate and report Dongguk‚Äôs public listing of "global partners" that no longer acknowledge active ties.

Raise awareness of the confirmed gap between Dongguk‚Äôs branding (ethical, Buddhist, international) and its actual governance, risk, and gender climate.

Share these facts with students, parents, and education agencies who may rely on inaccurate institutional representations.

This is a live, ongoing matter with further updates pending. More institutional denials are expected in the coming weeks.

We are available for background, further documentation, or interviews upon request.

Sincerely,
Gender Watchdog

Dear Editors,

üîó ‚ÄúDongguk University changes policy to help students who suffer verbal or sexual abuse‚Äù
https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2016/08/05/socialAffairs/Dongguk-University-changes-policy-to-help-students-who-suffer-verbal-or-sexual-abuse/3022260.html

Despite this past reform, new concerns have emerged about ongoing risk factors for sexual harassment and gender-based retaliation, especially in the Graduate School of Digital Media & Contents, which trains students for Korea‚Äôs competitive film and drama industry.

Moreover, Dongguk‚Äôs continued operation of a U.S.-accredited affiliate (DULA)‚Äîwhich receives federal funding and must comply with Title IX‚Äîcreates potential cross-border legal exposure and reputational risk for Korean higher education and international partners.

I‚Äôve contacted all U.S.-based partner universities listed on Dongguk‚Äôs website, as well as oversight bodies such as the U.S. Office for Civil Rights, ACE, WSCUC, and NAFSA.

Please review the complete email chain below, which connects these developments and includes documented outreach. I am available to speak on background or provide further materials upon request.

Dear Sirs and Madams,

I am writing to notify you of potential Title IX exposure risks arising from the affiliation between Dongguk University Los Angeles (DULA)‚Äîa U.S.-accredited, federally funded institution‚Äîand its originating institution, Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea.Relationship Between DULA (https://www.dula.edu/)¬†and Dongguk Korea

DULA was established through a 1997 merger with Dongguk University in Korea and functions as a legally separate nonprofit university, but it retains deep institutional ties, including:

Shared Buddhist governance and historical mission,

Cultural exchange programs involving travel to Korea,

A continuing public identity as Dongguk‚Äôs ‚ÄúU.S. campus.‚Äù

DULA participates in U.S. Title IV federal financial aid programs and is accredited by ACAHM. It publishes Title IX compliance guidelines and lists a Title IX coordinator. While DULA operates independently in the U.S., the visibility and influence of Dongguk Korea in its branding, governance, and programming create scenarios where Title IX exposure may arise, particularly if:

U.S. students or faculty are placed at risk during affiliated programs in Korea,

Dongguk Korea officials serve on boards or committees affecting DULA‚Äôs operations,

Harassment or retaliation at Dongguk Korea is normalized or covered up while affiliations persist.Problems at Dongguk Korea

Numerous concerns have been raised regarding systemic gender inequity, sexual harassment, and faculty gatekeeping behavior at Dongguk University in Seoul‚Äîparticularly in programs involving student-mentor dynamics in the arts and film departments. Victims face institutional retaliation and a lack of transparent reporting channels. These structural issues create unacceptable risk for any U.S. students studying at Dongguk or participating in collaborative programs.

All U.S.-based partner institutions of Dongguk University (as listed at: https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554) have been formally notified of these Title IX-related risks and have been asked to review or suspend their Memoranda of Understanding pending corrective action.Request

I urge your office to:

Review the governance and affiliations between DULA and Dongguk Korea,

Issue guidance to U.S. institutions engaging in international partnerships under Title IX and related statutes,

Consider launching an inquiry or internal review based on the facts outlined below.

Please refer to the full forwarded email chain below for documentation and further context. I remain available to provide evidence, timeline summaries, and NGO reports upon request.

(As of April 7, 2025, the following U.S.-based oversight and policy organizations have also been formally notified of potential Title IX exposure risks related to the institutional relationship between Dongguk University Los Angeles (DULA) and Dongguk University in Seoul, Korea:

American Council on Education (ACE)

Association of American Universities (AAU)

WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) ‚Äì DULA‚Äôs institutional accreditor

NAFSA: Association of International Educators

These organizations were contacted regarding:

The structural affiliations between DULA and Dongguk University Korea,

The legal and reputational risks associated with continuing international partnerships under conditions of systemic gender-based discrimination, and

The implications for U.S. institutions whose students may participate in affiliated programs abroad.

Each has been asked to review the governance structure, compliance obligations, and policy implications in accordance with Title IX and other federal oversight responsibilities.)

Dear International Office,

I am writing to inform you of escalating gender equity and structural risk concerns at Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea ‚Äî an institution publicly listed as one of your academic partners: ¬†
üëâ https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

More than three weeks have passed since I first raised these issues directly with Dongguk University on March 14, 2025. An updated version of that report was subsequently circulated to other Asian partner institutions on March 15 to highlight potential risks affecting both domestic and international students, including exchange participants from North America.

We are concerned that continuing exchange relations with Dongguk University may expose your institution to **Title IX non-compliance liability**, given that the host environment for graduate film students **lacks fundamental safeguards** for gender equity and harassment prevention.

Dongguk‚Äôs Master‚Äôs in Film program is **exclusively male-led**, situated in **physical proximity to entertainment industry actors**, and lacks a functioning **Women‚Äôs Student Council**. This constellation of factors raises **material risk for U.S. students**, particularly women, who may be placed into an environment with **no institutional protections, no female faculty**, and **elevated vulnerability to grooming, harassment, or coercion**.

Furthermore, even outside the film school, Dongguk‚Äôs **undergraduate and graduate programs in Buddhist Studies** ‚Äî despite the university‚Äôs religious origins ‚Äî also exhibit a **predominantly male faculty structure**, as publicly listed here: ¬†
üëâ https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/21

This raises reasonable concerns that other faculties at Dongguk may share **structural gender equity deficiencies**, creating a broader institutional risk pattern.

As there has been no formal response from Dongguk University to date, I am now following up with a consolidated summary of the most critical concerns. These include:

- A persistent lack of gender diversity in faculty appointments (notably, an all-male graduate film program)
- Heightened structural vulnerabilities due to the graduate school‚Äôs physical proximity to industry entities (e.g., Sidus FNH)
- Ongoing gaps in curriculum transparency, student protections, and institutional accountability

1. 2016: Professor Replacement Policy

Dongguk introduced a progressive rule in 2016 allowing students to request a different professor if they experienced verbal or sexual abuse:

https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2016/08/05/socialAffairs/Dongguk-University-changes-policy-to-help-students-who-suffer-verbal-or-sexual-abuse/3022260.html

This was a promising step to address power imbalances in academia.

Questions:

Has any student successfully invoked this professor replacement policy?

Is the policy still actively enforced in 2025, particularly in the Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents?2. 2018: MeToo Movement & Abolition of the Women‚Äôs Student Council

During the height of the MeToo movement in 2018, Dongguk abolished its Women‚Äôs Student Council ‚Äî previously a key advocacy group for female students:

https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EB%8F%99%EA%B5%AD%EB%8C%80%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90%20%EC%B4%9D%EC%97%AC%ED%95%99%EC%83%9D%ED%9A%8C%20%ED%8F%90%EC%A7%80%20%EC%82%AC%EA%B1%B4

The above website may not be accessible from your location in which case, please download the website .html files and other files from¬†https://drive.proton.me/urls/C2MFHP3D9W#7SjZXGAORThC

Questions:

Why was this student-led body dismantled during a period of heightened global awareness around sexual harassment?

Has Dongguk created any alternative group or mechanism to protect and represent female students?3. 2025: All-Male Faculty & Lack of Transparent Policies

As of 2025, the Master‚Äôs in Film program remains entirely male, according to Dongguk‚Äôs official site:

https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;

This creates significant power imbalances and raises the risk of unchecked misconduct. Contextual data includes:

Professors are often the main perpetrators of sexual abuse in Korean graduate schools

https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/06/181_309773.html

Korean universities grant excessive power to professors, increasing student vulnerability

alternate download link:¬†https://drive.proton.me/urls/BAPF2DA400#4RGLR08iLFAJ

Key Questions:

How does Dongguk justify having zero female faculty while claiming to uphold harassment prevention policies?

Without a Women‚Äôs Student Council, how can female or exchange students safely report misconduct?

Is the 2016 professor replacement policy still operational and publicly visible to students?4. On-Campus Industry Exposure & Structural Vulnerabilities

It has come to light that Sidus FNH, one of Korea‚Äôs top film production companies, shares physical space with the graduate school program.

This shared space radically increases the risk of boundary violations, especially when:

Students and industry staff interact informally in elevators, cafeterias, or shared hallways

Students may feel pressure to network with powerful men who can influence their future employment

There is no formal oversight of these interactions, nor structured protections for students (e.g., chaperoning, reporting mechanisms, professional boundaries)

The risk for sexual harassment, inappropriate recruitment practices, and psychological grooming is exacerbated in environments where:

Young women are dependent on connections

All-male faculty reinforce hierarchical silence

Industry insiders walk freely among vulnerable students

This arrangement is not just negligent ‚Äî it is dangerous.

Hoesik Risks:
Women in Korea are increasingly refusing to attend post-class or work drinking parties (hoesik) due to the risk of harassment:

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2900363

https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15546832

Yet without female faculty, ombudspersons, or safe reporting, students at Dongguk may feel pressured to attend these gatherings, particularly when linked to career advancement.5. Institutional Inaction Despite Known Risk Factors

Combined with:

The dissolution of the Women‚Äôs Student Council in 2018

The lack of female faculty members

And the absence of transparency around sexual harassment reporting history

‚Ä¶it is clear that Dongguk University is failing to maintain basic gender equity safeguards in line with global academic and labor standards.

A growing body of international research confirms that gender-diverse faculties contribute to better outcomes for¬†all¬†students ‚Äî not just female or international learners. For reference, please see this report: üëâ¬†https://drive.proton.me/urls/9GZC1335ZM#MyrCIqaix95o6. Symbolic Curriculum Bias: French Over English

The program emphasizes French language, while offering no English-language training or support ‚Äî despite English being the dominant language in global cinema:

English is used in international co-productions, global grants, and film festivals

Most international film industry networking, policy discourse, and distribution occurs in English

Questions:

Why is there no English-language component in the curriculum?

Does this decision reflect a male-centric fantasy about cinema rather than a practical learning objective?

This curriculum imbalance reflects:

Aesthetic elitism over employability

Coded masculinity hidden behind ‚Äútaste‚Äù and ‚Äútradition‚Äù

Lack of commitment to real-world career preparation for both female and international students7. "Policies Without Gender Balance Are Structural Performance, Not Protection"

Dongguk‚Äôs sexual harassment policy framework‚Äîwhile strong on paper‚Äîis structurally undermined by:

Zero female faculty

No women-led oversight

A dissolved student council

No published harassment data

As the Korean Women‚Äôs Association United has stated:

‚ÄúUniversities often establish sexual violence committees only as a formality ‚Äî without transparency, accountability, or protection for victims.‚Äù

This is consistent with well-documented cases at Seoul National University, Yonsei, and Chung-Ang.

In this system:

Female students face retaliation and reputational risk for speaking up

International women may fear for visas, careers, or grades

Male professors are effectively unaccountable

These are not safeguards. These are institutional liabilities masquerading as ethics.Requested Response

We respectfully request answers to the following:

Clarification on how the 2016 ‚Äúprofessor replacement‚Äù policy is enforced in 2025.

Explanation for the abolition of the Women‚Äôs Student Council in 2018, and whether any replacement body exists.

What steps Dongguk is taking to address the all-male faculty composition in the Master‚Äôs in Film program.

What safeguards exist to prevent exploitation or harassment involving Sidus FNH collaborations.

Clarification on the curricular decision to prioritize French cinema while excluding English-language cinema.

Whether Dongguk maintains any harassment reporting data, and if so, whether it is publicly available.Request for Accountability

We again urge:

Formal inquiry by partner institutions abroad

Suspension of academic partnerships with Dongguk University until gender equity reforms are implemented

Public disclosure of harassment reporting data and faculty gender balance over the last 5 years

Given the international community‚Äôs growing commitment to gender equality, we believe Dongguk University must clarify whether its policies, faculty structure, and academic culture meet global standards for a safe and inclusive educational environment.

We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Gender Watchdog
