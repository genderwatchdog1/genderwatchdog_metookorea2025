Dear
Editor / Research Team,

We
wish to bring to your attention serious ethical and structural
concerns surrounding Dongguk
University
in Seoul, South Korea — a school that appears in numerous global
university rankings and international academic exchange platforms.

Dongguk
University presents itself not only as a global academic institution
but as a moral
authority grounded in its affiliation with the Jogye Order, Korea’s
dominant Buddhist sect.
Its public identity emphasizes peace, compassion, and ethical
leadership. However, this “Buddhist
cloak” appears to serve as reputational armor,
deflecting scrutiny even as structural risks to student safety remain
unaddressed. 

Dongguk’s
Graduate
School of Digital Media and Contents,
which oversees its Master’s program in film, presents documented
structural risk factors for sexual
violence
and institutional
misrepresentation:🚨 Structural
Risk of Sexual Violence in Film Programs

This
risk is not theoretical. According to the Korea
Women’s Development Institute (KWDI)
report titled "Current
Status of Sexual Violence Against University Students in the Culture
and Arts after the Me Too Movement and Policy Issues",
students in arts-focused programs face a statistically
higher risk of sexual violence
from professors and other authority figures. The study documents:“Sexual
violence by professors against students remains widespread in the
culture and arts sectors, and often involves power imbalances, career
gatekeeping, and physical proximity during off-campus
activities.”

KWDI,
2021, p. 4

At
Dongguk University, this risk is compounded by:

An
	entirely
	male faculty
	in its film master's program (as of April 2025)

Physical
	co-location with commercial film companies such as Sidus
	FNH,
	a major entertainment entity

The
	abolition
	of the Women’s Student Council
	during the height of the #MeToo movement in 2018

No
	visible, independent mechanisms
	for reporting sexual harassment

These
conditions collectively constitute a structural
vulnerability,
increasing the likelihood of abuse and decreasing the probability
that such abuse would be reported or fairly adjudicated.🧾 Confirmed
Cases of Institutional Misrepresentation

Despite
these red flags, Dongguk continues to publicly list a wide range of
U.S., Canadian, and European universities as partners on its official
website:

We
have contacted several of these institutions directly. Two examples
are especially troubling:

🇨🇦 Canada:“We
do not have a student exchange agreement with Dongguk University. As
a result, please DO NOT include our institution in the article and
when you communicate with any journalists or media.”

🇺🇸 United
States:“Greetings,

Thank
you for making us aware of this situation. We are undergoing a review
of all of our exchange partners and will take this into consideration
and will reach out to our partners at Dongguk accordingly.

Please
do not quote me in any articles or further emails. Thank you.

These
responses confirm that some
schools currently listed by Dongguk have no active relationship
with the university. This suggests possible false
advertising of partnerships,
which may distort public rankings and mislead international
applicants.🔍 What
We Urge Your Organization to Do

We
respectfully urge your organization to:

Review
	Dongguk University’s inclusion in rankings or listings
	that weigh equity, international transparency, partnership
	integrity, or student safety.

Request
	clarification
	from Dongguk University regarding its listed international partners
	and the steps it has taken to mitigate structural sexual violence
	risk.

Consider
	issuing a formal caution or suspension notice
	to Dongguk in future rankings or institutional profiles until
	minimum equity and safety standards are met.

full archive of sources and institutional correspondence is publicly
available here:

These
concerns are not just institutional—they are deeply ethical. A
university that claims spiritual legitimacy while failing to protect
students from known risks faces a crisis of credibility. Dongguk’s
continued invocation of Buddhist identity in promotional materials
raises
serious concerns about moral branding being used to obscure
structural harm.

This
is a live and ongoing situation, and more university denials are
expected in the coming weeks. We would be happy to provide additional
documentation upon request.

Sincerely,
Gender
