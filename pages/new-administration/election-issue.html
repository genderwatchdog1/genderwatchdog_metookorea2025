                <p class="lead">With President Lee Jae-myung's election victory with 49.42% support, the new administration's genuine commitment to reform and the future of Korean democracy are being tested through the resolution of Dongguk University's sexual violence cover-up, falsified partnerships, and the Sidus crisis.</p>
            </div>
            <article class="prose mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
                <h2>Global Attention: Expectations Focused on the New Administration</h2>
                <p>Following Dongguk University's sexual violence cover-up, falsified partnerships, and Sidus's explosive legal threats, South Korea has come under unprecedented international scrutiny. Our advocacy campaign has reached prosecutors, police, government agencies, major media outlets, embassies, human rights organizations, and global education bodies. The entire world is watching President Lee Jae-myung's response.</p>
                
                <h2>New Administration with High Reform Motivation</h2>
                <p>This crisis emerges as the new administration takes office at a historic moment. Following the unprecedented situation of former President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law declaration and impeachment, President Lee Jae-myung, elected with a high voter turnout of 77.8%, is seen not merely as a regime change but as a symbol of genuine democratic restoration. The new administration has high motivation to implement structural reforms in higher education, women's safety, and government transparency.</p>
                
                <h2>Media and Civil Society: Expectations for the New Administration</h2>
                <p>Despite overwhelming evidence, many Korean media outlets have shown passive attitudes due to legal risks, institutional pressure, and uncertainty. However, with international media, embassies, and advocacy groups now fully aware of all the facts, transparent responses from the new administration have become more important than ever. Civil society holds high expectations for President Lee Jae-myung, a former human rights lawyer who promised "not to disappoint the people's expectations."</p>
                
                <h2>Opportunities and Challenges Facing the New President</h2>
                <p>This case presents an excellent opportunity for President Lee Jae-myung to demonstrate his reform will. A new administration that realizes transparency, victim protection, and structural reform can solidify the trust of youth, women, and the international community. Having promised "economic revitalization, inequality reduction, and national unity" during the campaign, resolving this scandal will be the first test of implementing those pledges.</p>
                
                <h2>What's at Stake: Democracy, Education, Women's Safety, and Elimination of Racism</h2>
                <p>This is not just about one university or one company. The Dongguk/Sidus/IEQAS scandal exposes serious flaws in South Korea's higher education system, government oversight, and treatment of sexual violence victims. Particularly, witness testimonies on the Xiaohongshu (小红书) platform revealed that foreign female students have become targets of sexual violence due to Korean xenophobia. This proves that sexual violence is not merely individual deviance but a serious social problem combined with structural racism.</p>
                <p>The new administration must answer these critical questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can the new Korean democracy realize justice and reform while the whole world watches?</li>
                    <li>Will they restore trust among international students and partner institutions in Korean universities?</li>
                    <li>Will they introduce substantive policies to protect women and vulnerable students?</li>
                    <li>Will they address the structural problems where xenophobia and racism fuel sexual violence?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Call to Action for the New Administration</h2>
                <p><strong>To the Lee Jae-myung Administration:</strong> Show the reform spirit you pledged through this case. Concrete action for genuine change is needed.</p>
                <p><strong>To Citizens:</strong> Continue pressuring the new administration. Monitor to ensure the change you chose through voting becomes reality.</p>
                <p><strong>To Students and Faculty:</strong> Continue speaking out. The new administration has the will to listen to your voices.</p>
                <p><strong>To the International Community:</strong> Watch and support whether South Korea's new administration meets the standards of transparency and justice expected of global leaders.</p>

                    <strong>At the starting point of the new administration, resolving the Dongguk scandal is an important test to demonstrate President Lee Jae-myung's reform will and the maturity of Korean democracy. The entire world expects change from South Korea.</strong>
